# Learning goals

* Understand the process of create reproducible documents
* Have a first insight in the data visualization practices using datasets
* Experience the diversity of options that open practices offers to communicate your results.

## Assignments for ARCHE Plateform

After that, several questions need to be answered at the end of the tutorial. 

A pdf document with the results  are going to be upload to the ARCHE Platform to evaluate the comprehension of the module.

# Reproducibility and Replicability

**Reproducibility**: 

Refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original researcher (Goodman, Fanelli, and Ioannidis 2016).

- Focuses on the validity of the data analysis
- "Can we trust this analysis?"

.footnote[

Goodman, Steven N., Daniele Fanelli, and John P. A. Ioannidis. 2016. “What Does Research Reproducibility Mean?” Science Translational Medicine 8 (341): 341ps12–341ps12. https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf5027.

]
--

**Replicability:** 

This is the act of repeating an entire study, independently of the original investigator without the use of original data (but generally using the same methods).

- Important for policymakers and regulatory decisions


---


## Why do we need Reproducible Research?

- Avoid misconduct such as fraudulent data and plagiarism
- Data-intensive research (e.g Big data research)
- Distributed research

## Reproducibility concepts

Two key elements: 

- **Literate programming for enabling reproducibilty**
- Version control for enhancing transparency

*...for significantly better documentation of programs, <br>and that we can best achieve <br>this by considering programs to be works of literature.*

## Literate programming for enabling reproducibilty

*Literate programming refers to the use of a computing environment for authoring documents that contain a mix of natural (eg. English) and computer (eg. R) languages (Schulte et al. 2012)*

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align='center', cache=TRUE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Word-excel.jpg")
```

## What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)

#  What is Data Visualization?

- are graphical representations of data
- use different colors, shapes, and the coordinate system to summarize data
- tell a story
- are useful for exploring data

# Summary

- Reproducible research is important as a **minimum standard**, particularly for studies that are difficult to replicate
- Infrastructure is needed for creating and distributing reproducible documents, beyond what is currently available
- There is a growing number of tools for creating reproducible documents

**Some challengues**

- It is not the solution for everyone.

# Tidyverse

.pull-left[
- **Ordocosme** in `r emo::ji("fr")` with *Tidy* for "bien rangé" and *verse*_* for "universe"
- A collection of R `r emo::ji("package")` developed by [Hadley Wickham](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=YA43PbsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and others at Rstudio

>Tidyverse is a .bg-green[language for solving data science challenges with R code]. 
Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. 
Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to
learn the next.

# Tidyverse

* "A framework for managing data that aims at making the cleaning and preparing steps [muuuuuuuch] easier" (Julien Barnier).

* Main characteristics of a tidy dataset:
    - each variable is a column
    - each observation is a raw
    - each value is in a different cell

# 1. Import data

**readr::read_csv** function:

* ~~keeps input types as is (no conversion to factor)~~ (since `R` 4.0.0)

* creates `tibbles` instead of `data.frame`
     - no names to rows
     - allows column names with special characters (see next slide)
     - more clever on screen display than w/ data.frames (see next slide)
     - [no partial matching on column names](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58513997/how-to-make-r-stop-accepting-partial-matches-for-column-names)
     - warning if attempt to access unexisting column

* is daaaaaamn fast `r emo::ji("racing_car")`
