However, the cost of the feedstock for additive manufacturing and the additive manufactured parts is usually very high, which hinders the further application of additive manufacturing, especially for the metal additive manufacturing. The concept of circular metal additive manufacturing involves the recycling of the metal feedstock and the additive manufactured parts leading to the truly zero waste production and the most energy saving. This paper reviews the technologies that help the formation of a circular metal additive manufacturing through recycling of the feedstocks and the damaged metal parts. Reactive metals, such as titanium, tend to be contaminated easily during handling and production. Recycling of the titanium for achieving a circular titanium additive manufacturing is reviewed in detail.

When the thermoplastics based materials are gathered in the form of the waste, and these declared as not to use further in any applications, then it processed through the chemical and thermal recycling for reuse and energy generation. The ternary and quaternary type of recycling processes are among the four basic recycling processes, which is considered under the chemical and thermal recycling process, respectively. The additive manufacturing is one of the revolutionary tools of a modern manufacturing system that can be used for recycling by chemical and thermal mean. This study is the state of art review for the additive manufacturing tools and techniques for the ternary and quaternary recycling of the thermoplastic waste. The thermal sustainability of the additively manufactured thermoplastic-based materials is the main highlights of this study. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A novel recycling approach, which integrated carbon fiber reclamation and composite additive manufacturing, is proposed to process the CFRP waste into three Dimensional (3D) parts. In the experiments, the CFRP waste was recycled by supercritical n-butanol to yield reclaimed Carbon Fibers (rCFs). The rCFs were ground by a ball mill, mixed with Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone (PEEK) powder and then extruded to the composite filament. The filament was fed to the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printer to fabricate 3D parts. Mechanical and electrical properties of the parts were investigated and compared with that of pure PEEK. The results illustrate that the additive manufacturing-based approach offers a potential strategy to reuse the CFRP waste and rapidly fabricate the rCF reinforced plastics with complex geometry and function.

AFSD enables manufacturing of near net shape, fully dense builds with refined equiaxed grain structure resulting in excellent mechanical properties. AFSD has the potential to produce ingots and components/builds from recycled metals (chips/scraps/wastes from industrial machining processes or municipal recycling centers). In the present study, recycled Ti-6Al-4V alloy chips were deposited using additive friction stir deposition. Detailed microstructural and mechanical property investigation of the deposited material fosters understanding of the effect of deposition variables on the microstructure as well as mechanical properties. The as-deposited microstructure was characterized by lamellar alpha/beta colonies inside fine equiaxed prior beta grains containing alpha phase at the grain boundary. Additive friction stir deposited Ti-6Al-4V alloy using consolidated recycled metal chips as raw material exhibited tensile properties better than other additive processes; thus, AFSD of recycled metal provides opportunities to produce structurally sound components with reduced energy consumption as well as reducing environmental waste.

An emerging idea is to incorporate composite recyclate in additive manufacturing. The focus of this work was to develop this capability and research the functional performance of additive manufactured parts through incorporating recyclate fibre in fused deposition modeling material. The research focused on additive manufacturing with virgin acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and recyclate fibre reinforced ABS. The effect on tensile strength for different fibres (recycled by pyrolysis and mechanical process) was evaluated. Tensile test result showed an improvement by 43%, 49% and 69% when ABS was reinforced with mechanically recycled fibre, Pyrolysis recycled fibre and virgin carbon fibre respectively. The work identified the key potential for additive manufacturing to utilize recyclate and functional benefits as well as the areas for further scientific research. This is important for new innovations for use of composite recyclate to improve the functionality of additively manufactured parts. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Recycled AISI 316L and standard AISI 316L materials were used to produce powders via gas atomization process, and two additive manufacturing technologies, i.e., selective laser melting and laser metal deposition, were investigated. This study aims to determine the feasibility of using recycled material to produce powders for additive manufacturing. For each technology, the effect of process parameters on the solidification of the recycled powders was evaluated. Then, tensile tests were conducted on the specimens produced using the optimized process parameters. Specimens from both the technologies exhibited higher ultimate tensile strength values than standard AISI 316L. Recycled powders made from selective laser melting and laser metal deposition exhibited tensile strength values of 653 +/- 1.79 MPa and 675 +/- 2 MPa, respectively, whereas the standard powders exhibited a tensile strength of 594 +/- 0.89 and 585 +/- 3.1 MPa, respectively. We conclude that recycled AISI 316L can be used to produce powders for AM applications, resulting in good processability and high mechanical properties. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Plastic recycling in additive manufacturing: A systematic literature review and opportunities for the circular economy	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Review						Distributed recycling; Plastic recycling; Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Circular economy	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; OF-THE-ART; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; DIMENSIONAL ACCURACY; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; EXTRUSION SYSTEM; VALUE CREATION; WASTE POLYMER; LARGE-SCALE; 3D PRINTER	The rapid technical evolution of additive manufacturing (AM) enables a new path to a circular economy using distributed recycling and production. This concept of Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is related to the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. This paper aims to examine the current advances on thermoplastic recycling processes via additive manufacturing technologies. After proposing a closed recycling global chain for DRAM, a systematic literature review including 92 papers from 2009 to 2019 was performed using the scopus, web of science and springer databases. This work examines main topics from six stages (recovery, preparation, compounding, feedstock, printing, quality) of the proposed DRAM chain. The results suggested that few works have been done for the recovery and preparation stages, while a great progress has already been done for the other stages in order to validate the technical feasibility, environmental impact, and economic viability. Potential research paths in the pre-treatment of recycled material at local level and printing chain phases were identified in order to connect the development of DRAM with the circular economy ambition at micro, meso and macro level. The development of each stage proposed using the open source approach is a relevant path to scale DRAM to reach the full technical potential as a centerpiece of the circular economy.

This work presents a novel additive manufacturing-based recycling approach that can be used to reclaim CFRP waste and to re-manufacture the carbon fiber into 3D printed composite parts. A trial of this idea was set up, in which carbon fiber was first reclaimed from CFRP waste using supercritical fluid and then mixed with Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone to produce composite filaments. The filaments were then fed into a printer of fused deposition modeling (i.e., a 3D printing process) and the recycled CFRP parts were fabricated. The engineering application-oriented tests demonstrate that the reclaimed carbon fiber can modify the performances of 3D printed part effectively in terms of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, heat conduction and wear resistance. This work illustrates that the additive manufacturing-based recycling approach offers a possible strategy to recycle CFRP waste and fabricate high-performance engineering parts with complex geometries, which are economical and environmentally friendly.

A technical review of the challenges of powder recycling in the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE			English	Review								Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is one of the most widely used additive manufacturing techniques for fabrication of components with complex geometries for various industrial applications including aerospace, medical and automotive. The unconsumed powder after part manufacturing is often recovered and recycled to improve process efficiency. However, some of the particles in the recycled powder can have different physical and chemical properties from those in the virgin powder owing to their exposure to the complex environment during the manufacturing process. In addition, some contaminants can be introduced in the recycled powder due to poor process control. A number of studies have been published in the past few years revealing the effects of powder recycling on the build properties. The present work aims to highlight the key phenomena during the manufacturing process that caused degradation to the recycled powder. Further to this, some comments, gaps and areas that deserve further detailed studies are also highlighted.

Specimens were produced by means of pellet additive manufacturing (PAM) adopting different infill patterns to investigate the influence of material anisotropy. For comparison purposes, the mechanical properties of the same virgin and recycled materials were investigated also with injection-molded specimens. The fracture behavior was investigated by analyzing the damage at a macroscopic as well as microscopic level. As the main outcome, it was noted that both the manufacturing and recycling processes play a crucial role in the damage mechanics of the specimens, thus explaining the different fracture behaviors noted at the macroscale.

Rubber toughened recycled polyethylene terephthalate for material extrusion additive manufacturing	POLYMER INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						recycled polyethylene terephthalate; 3D printing; rubber toughened; material extrusion additive manufacturing; SEBS	POLY(ETHYLENE-TEREPHTHALATE) BLENDS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; SEMICRYSTALLINE PET; MORPHOLOGY; TOUGHNESS; POLYMERS; BEHAVIOR; MATRIX	Plastic packaging materials represent a new class of low-cost and sustainable additive manufacturing feedstocks. Recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been shown to be a robust material for material extrusion additive manufacturing, with mechanical properties comparable with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene. However, due to PET's high crystallinity, it is generally a brittle material and can be subject to premature fracture. It is well known that the addition of rubbers can serve to toughen PET. In this work, micronized rubber powder, as well as non-reactive and functionalized styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene (SEBS) elastomers were compounded with recycled PET. Tensile strength was not significantly affected, but toughness increased 85% with the addition of 5 wt% rubber, 350% with SEBS and over 550% with maleic anhydride functionalized SEBS compared to neat recycled PET. Fracture surface analysis revealed evidence of ductile fracture and cavitation in the rubber toughened samples. Published 2020.

This paper represents an investigation into the particle size distribution, morphology and flow-ability of Ti6Al4V powder used in EBM process. The effect of recycling of the powder on the chemical properties has been investigated. Results show that recycling increases the weight percentage of interstitial elements.

Direct recycling of machine chips through a novel solid-state additive manufacturing process	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Additive friction stir deposition; Recycling; Solid-state; Microstructure; Mechanical properties	BEHAVIOR	Recycling of metal waste for feedstock material in additive manufacturing (AM) is typically carried out through energy extensive melting and solidification processing techniques. However, in austere environments, energy production can be limited and thus melting down scrap into powder through an atomization process is not a viable approach to producing feedstock from reclaimed waste. However, advancements in solid-state material processing has led to a novel additive manufacturing process that uses solid, macroscale structural feed-rods that allow for high deposition rates with wrought-like mechanical properties. This process, additive friction stir deposition (AFS-D), leverages friction between the rotating feed-rod and the substrate (or previous deposition layer) to soften and promote material flow that creates a plasticized and metallurgically bonded material layer. As such, the AFS-D approach is ideally suited to directly process metal waste with minimal material preparation. To illustrate this concept, we demonstrate AM builds with refined microstructure and wrought-like properties made using loose machines chips. The results of this study demonstrate the potential to recycle metal machine chips by feeding them directly into the AFS-D process and produce structurally sound depositions that can be used for Point-of-Need manufacturing within austere environments.

This results in the generation of thousands of tons of residual polymeric packaging waste, which is either left behind in the environment or otherwise recycled or incinerated at a cost of several millions of U.S. dollars per year. Advancements in distributed recycling technologies now allow for on-demand reconstitution of traditionally neglected MRE pouch waste into useful appliances via material extrusion additive manufacturing. In this work, we demonstrate recycling of MRE pouch materials through a combined compounding, filament extrusion, and fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing protocol. Mechanical properties and barrier properties of additively manufactured structures were evaluated through tensile testing and water vapor transmission testing, respectively, and found to be comparable to the native pouch materials. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analysis of the extruded filament and printed materials were contrasted with native pouch materials, showing minimal effects of the manufacturing process on critical thermal transitions in the polymer. Economics and viability of on-demand reconstitution using these proposed methods are briefly discussed and reveal the multiple benefits of this recycling process.

Glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETG) is known to have some enhanced properties as compared to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) homopolymer; this has recently attracted the interest from the fused filament fabrication (FFF) three-dimensional (3D) printing community. PET has shown a reduced ability for repeated recycling through traditional processes. Herein, we demonstrate the potential for using recycled PETG in consecutive 3D printing manufacturing processes. Distributed recycling additive manufacturing (DRAM)-oriented equipment was chosen in order to test the mechanical and thermal response of PETG material in continuous recycling processes. Tensile, flexure, impact strength, and Vickers micro-hardness tests were carried out for six (6) cycles of recycling. Finally, Raman spectroscopy as well as thermal and morphological analyses via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) fractography were carried out. In general, the results revealed a minor knockdown effect on the mechanical properties as well as the thermal properties of PETG following the process proposed herein, even after six rounds of recycling.

Tests were carried out initially using virgin ABS, which subsequently underwent two successive closed-loop filament extrusion and 3D printing phases. For each endpoint manufacturing phase, samples were examined to monitor the changes in thermal characteristics, mechanical properties, and polymer degradation. It was found that there was a series of physical changes of the polymer, which resulted in reduced melt flow, increased glass transition temperature, and the generation of carbonyl groups, which may be attributed to the thermal oxidative breakdown of both styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) and butadiene components of ABS. The recycled polymer also showed a reduction in both tensile and compressive strengths compared to the virgin material. However, compared to one-time recycled ABS, two-times recycled ABS showed increased strength, implying that increased recycle state of the polymer may be advantageous with respect to mechanical properties and potential manufacturing applications. This study ultimately demonstrates the potential to leverage additive manufacturing (AM) toward a closed-loop manufacturing paradigm by using waste ABS across several life cycles.

J	Sanchez, FAC; Boudaoud, H; Hoppe, S; Camargo, M				Sanchez, Fabio A. Cruz; Boudaoud, Hakim; Hoppe, Sandrine; Camargo, Mauricio			Polymer recycling in an open-source additive manufacturing context: Mechanical issues	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						3D printing; Plastic recycling; Mechanical properties; PLA; Open source additive manufacturing; RepRap		Nowadays, the low recycling rate of polymers is still a challenge to humankind due to energy, economic and logistical issues. In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability.

State-of-the-art powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes typically use spherical powder that are produced using an atomization process. However, using irregularly shaped Ti-6Al-4V powder from the Hydride-Dehydride (HDH) process is more economical because fewer processing steps are required and it can use recycled material as feedstock. In this work, the use of HDH powder in the electron beam additive manufacturing (EBAM) process is investigated. Deposition parameters for the HDH powder were developed, followed by a detailed study of as-built porosity and microstructure. The powder flow characteristics were also studied, and the as-built part porosity was compared to the parts built using spherical atomized powder. This work demonstrates the successful use of non-spherical HDH powder in the EBAM process.

MAR 12, 2019	San Antonio, TX	Minerals Metals & Mat Soc		Metal additive; Manufacturing; Stainless steel; Sustainability; Ball milling	FEEDSTOCK POWDER; SUSTAINABILITY	To fulfill the growing demand for alternative and sustainable feedstock production for metal additive manufacturing, a novel dual-stage ball milling strategy was proposed to effectively convert recycled stainless-steel machining chips to powder with desirable characteristics for metal additive manufacturing. A theoretical analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of ball size on the chips-to-powder evolution and the consequent powder morphology. To verify the viability of using the ball milled powder created from machining chips in metal additive manufacturing, single tracks have been successfully deposited via laser engineered net shaping deposition and compared to the single tracks made from gas atomized powder using identical deposition conditions. The microstructures of these single tracks exhibited adequate adhesion to the substrate, a uniform melt pool geometry, continuity, and minimal splatter. Minimal differences in grain structure were observed between the single tracks made from ball milled powder and those made from gas atomized powder.

Recycling of such materials is mostly a thermomechanical process that modifies their overall mechanical behavior. The present research work focuses on the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer, which is the second most popular material used in FFF-3D printing. In order to investigate the effect of the recycling courses on the mechanical response of the ABS polymer, an experimental simulation of the recycling process that isolates the thermomechanical treatment from other parameters (i.e., contamination, ageing, etc.) has been performed. To quantify the effect of repeated recycling processes on the mechanic response of the ABS polymer, a wide variety of mechanical tests were conducted on FFF-printed specimens. Regarding this, standard tensile, compression, flexion, impact and micro-hardness tests were performed per recycle repetition. The findings prove that the mechanical response of the recycled ABS polymer is generally improved over the recycling repetitions for a certain number of repetitions. An optimum overall mechanical behavior is found between the third and the fifth repetition, indicating a significant positive impact of the ABS polymer recycling, besides the environmental one.

Additive manufacturing technology has been emerging as a solution, enhancing circular economy models, and using recycled composites for glass fiber-reinforced polymers is spreading as a new additive manufacturing trend. Nevertheless, their mechanical properties are still not comparable to pristine materials. The purpose of this paper is to examine the additive re-manufacturing of end-of-life glass fiber composites with mechanical performances that are comparable to virgin glass fiber-reinforced materials. Through a systematic characterization of the recyclate, requirements of the filler for the liquid deposition modeling process were identified. Printability and material surface quality of different formulations were analyzed using a low-cost modified 3D printer. Two hypothetical design concepts were also manufactured to validate the field of application. Furthermore, an understanding of the mechanical behavior was accomplished by means of tensile tests, and the results were compared with a benchmark formulation with virgin glass fibers. Mechanically recycled glass fibers show the capability to substitute pristine fillers, unlocking their use for new fields of application.

Hence, manufacturing components starting from recycled activated material originated by DEMO reactor, with the relative manufacturing techniques, might be an important factor to support the environmental sustainability of fusion radioactive waste management. Accordingly, in this work the feasibility of recycling materials from decommissioned nuclear plants are presented. In the initial part, the powder production from activated steels AISI 316 L(N) and EUROFER and their use by Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies is investigated as studied during EUROfusion Consortium funded activities. Chemical-physical parameters of this processed materials have been defined, together with the viability, of producing metal powders with an industrial VIGA (Vacuum Induction Gas Atomizer) facility. Experimental activities have been performed, aiming at powder production by VIGA and its characterization. A preliminary analysis of processing of these powders via selective laser melting (SLM) has been carried out. Additional results are presented for the experiments carried out on the decarburization of AISI 316 L(N) and EUROFER and experiments on the pollution of solid lithium orthosilicate breeder (Li4SiO4) coming from the refractory material, by simulating the thermal process of Li4SiO4 production or recycling, assessing the impact of platinum, zirconia, graphite and mullite on the quality of Li4SiO4 and on the feasibility of removing radioactive impurities.

A novel gas atomization process was used to produce the feedstock for a powder bed fusion process by recycling and melting used Inconel parts. An analysis of the melt-pool geometry and microstructure was conducted using finite element method to determine the optimal print parameters for an EOS M100 3D printer. Densities and mechanical properties of recycled Inconel 718 were tested for various printing parameters using standard test methods and anisotropic tensile behavior of additively manufactured parts were studied. The experimental data were compared with historical and simulated data and indicated equal or better properties compared to the baseline. Chemical composition, microstructure, and fracture surface of broken samples were also examined. Finally, a simulation of the additive manufacturing process was performed using the mechanical properties results and was used to redesign and build a turbine for an automotive turbocharger. The results of this study indicate that scrap Inconel 718 parts can be used to additively manufacture high-quality functional parts.

Additive friction stir deposition: a deformation processing route to metal additive manufacturing	MATERIALS RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; deformation processing; additive friction stir deposition; equiaxed microstructure; repair and recycling		As the forging counterpart of fusion-based additive processes, additive friction stir deposition offers a solid-state deformation processing route to metal additive manufacturing, in which every voxel of the feed material undergoes severe plastic deformation at elevated temperatures. In this perspective article, we outline its key advantages, e.g. rendering fully-dense material in the as-printed state with fine, equiaxed microstructures, identify its niche engineering uses, and point out future research needs in process physics and materials innovation. We argue that additive friction stir deposition will evolve into a major additive manufacturing solution for industries that require high load-bearing capacity with minimal post-processing.

However, one of the major milestones of adopting the technology is still the high price of metal powder in comparison to casting methods. Using recycled powder to additively manufacture parts can be considered one way to decrease the final price in this technology. In the present paper, the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of the DMLS-AIS10Mg_200C alloy manufactured by recycled powder were investigated. As the first step of this research, the powder characteristics, i.e. morphology, average particle size, microstructure and composition, of virgin, condensate and recycled AlSi10Mg powder were studied. It was inferred that virgin and recycled powders had comparable powder characteristics, which are very different in comparison to the condensate powder. In the second step of this research, microstructural and mechanical characterization of the as-built DMLS-AlS10Mg_200C alloy using recycled powder revealed that elongation of horizontally built DMLS-AlSi10Mg_200C was higher compared to that of vertically built. In addition, the fracture surfaces of vertically and horizontally built samples were investigated and possible fracture modes discussed. It is confirmed that, the microstructure and mechanical behavior of the as-built as-built DMLS-AlS10Mg_200C manufactured by recycled powder were similar to that of virgin powder.

These great characteristics are accompanied by some recycling difficulties of the final products, particularly originated from the tire waste rubber industry. In this study, recycled tire rubber was incorporated in polymer matrices using selective laser sintering as 3D printing technology. Two polymers were used-polyamide and thermoplastic polyurethane, for their rigid and elastomeric properties, respectively. Polymer composites containing various tire powder amounts, up to 40 wt.%, were prepared by physical blending. The final materials' morphological characteristics, mechanical properties, and thermal stability were evaluated. The proposed ambitious additive manufacturing approach looked over also some of the major aspects to be considered during the 3D printing procedure. In addition, examples of printed prototypes with potential applications were also proposed revealing the potential of the recycled tire rubber-loaded composites.

Technical pathways for distributed recycling of polymer composites for distributed manufacturing: Windshield wiper blades	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Polymer composite; Recycling; Additive manufacturing; Distributed recycling; Distributed manufacturing; 3D printing	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PROCESS PARAMETERS; EXTRUSION SYSTEM; WASTE POLYMER; REPRAP; FILAMENT; POLYETHYLENE; FABRICATION; LOOP	Centralized waste plastic recycling is economically challenging, yet distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) provides consumers with direct economic incentives to recycle. This study explores the technical pathways for DRAM of complex polymer composites using a case study of windshield wiper blades. These blades are a thermoplastic composite made up of a soft (flexible) and hard (less flexible) material. The distributed manufacturing methods included mechanical grinding to fused granular fabrication, heated syringe printing, 3-D printed molds coupled to injection molding and filament production in a recyclebot to fused filament fabrication. The particle size, angle of repose, thermal and rheological properties are characterized for the two sub-materials to define the conditions for the extrusion. A successful pathway for fabricating new products was found and the mechanical properties of the resultant components were quantified. Finally, the means to convert scrap windshield wiper blades into useful, high-value, bespoke biomedical products of fingertip grips for hand prosthetics was demonstrated. This study showed that the DRAM model of materials recycling can be used to improve the variety of solutions for a circular economy.

In last two decades, some studies have reported use of primary (1 degrees), secondary (2 degrees), tertiary (3 degrees) and quaternary (4 degrees) ways to process polymeric materials from recycling view point. But hither to little has been reported on standardisation of 1 degrees /2 degrees /3 degrees /4 degrees routes in AM applications. The present study bridges the gaps for use of 1 degrees /2 degrees /3 degrees /4 degrees routes as an industrial processing standard with low cost AM technology (which have been presented as four case studies for field engineers).

If not significantly different from the feedstock, the recycled powder can be reused many times without a detrimental impact on the mechanical properties of the final printed parts, which reduces the metallic powder waste and printing time. A detailed characterization and comparison of the feedstock and recycled powders is essential in order to understand the number of times a powder can be recycled. The recycled powders were sampled after 10 times reuse in the Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) process in the 3D printer. In this paper, we have performed a detailed characterization on morphology, microstructure, and the surface and bulk composition of virgin feedstock and recycled stainless steel 316 L powders (over 10 times reused), and correlated these measurements to topography, nanoindentation and hardness tests. We have also performed rarely reported synchrotron surface characterization of both powder sets in order to measure the level of oxidation of the individual metallic elements present in the virgin and recycled steel powder and the way such chemical composition changes following use in the manufacturing process. The results show more satellite and bonded particles in the recycled powder although the particle size is not broadly impacted. The atomic force microscopy results showed a smaller roughness on recycled powders measured on surfaces without satellites which might be due to less surface dendrites on recycled powder surface. Finally, a higher hardness was measured for the recycled powder resulted from the manufacturing process on grains and chemical composition. The results suggest no significant changes on the mechanical properties of the printed parts depending for a certain number of reusing cycles.

Owing to the continuous diffusion of 3D printing driven by low-cost entry-level material extrusion printers, sustainability of a so popular AM technology is of paramount importance. Therefore, recycling 3D printed wastes and 3D parts again at the end of their life is an important issue to be addressed. Research efforts are directed towards the improvement of the biodegradability of 3D printing filaments and the replacement of oil based feedstock with bio-based compostable plastics. The aim of this work is to describe the state of the art about development and use of recycled or biodegradable filaments in 3D printing. Beyond a critical review of the literature, open issues and research opportunities are presented.

The effect of recycling on the oxygen distribution in Ti-6Al-4V powder for additive manufacturing	MATERIALS AT HIGH TEMPERATURES			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; electron microscopy; microstructure; morphology; oxygen distribution; powder recycling; titanium alloy	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TITANIUM-ALLOYS; HEAT-TREATMENT; BETA-TITANIUM; ALPHA; TEMPERATURE; PHASE; REUSE	Ti-6Al-4V powder has been recycled 30 times in an electron beam melting system. A combination of electron microscopy techniques has been used to show that the recycled powder has a 35% higher oxygen content, and that the particles have a more irregular morphology, a narrower particle size distribution, and a much more variable microstructure than the virgin powder. The microstructures in the recycled powder particles vary from a martensitic alpha' structure, which is identical to that in the virgin powder, to a two-phase alpha + beta structure. This variability is related to the complex thermal history of the unmelted metal powder in the system. Despite these differences, all of the particles exhibit essentially the same surface oxide thickness; the excess oxygen in the recycled powders is instead located in the beta phase. The possible consequences for the structure and properties of the resultant additively manufactured parts are discussed.

The pre-heating and blasting processes that occur during recycling were found to degrade the perfectly spherical morphology of the powder, and the concentration of O and N were also increased by about 15%. This resulted in it changing to a Grade-3 CP Ti powder; however, the purity of the final product was improved to Grade-1 CP Ti by the slight refining effect of the EBM process.

The characterization of these powders is important in NIST efforts to develop appropriate measurements and standards for additive materials and to document the property of powders used in a NIST-led additive manufacturing material round robin. An extensive array of characterization techniques was applied to these two powders, in both virgin and recycled states. The physical techniques included laser diffraction particle size analysis, X-ray computed tomography for size and shape analysis, and optical and scanning electron microscopy. Techniques sensitive to chemistry, including X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive analytical X-ray analysis using the X-rays generated during scanning electron microscopy, were also employed. Results of these analyses will be used to shed light on the question: how does virgin powder change after being exposed to and recycled from one or more additive manufacturing build cycles? In addition, these findings can give insight into the actual additive manufacturing process.	[Slotwinski, J.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques are used to determine and evaluate the evolution of morphology, particle size distribution (PSD), circularity, chemical composition, and phase (crystal structure) in the virgin and recycled powders of both materials. The results indicate that both recycled powders increase the average particle sizes and shift the PSD to higher values, compared with their virgin powders. The recycled 316L SS powder particles largely retain their spherical and near-spherical morphologies, whereas more irregularly shaped morphologies are observed for the recycled AlSi10Mg counterpart. The average circularity of recycled 316L SS powder only reduces by similar to 2%, but decreases similar to 17% for the recycled AlSi10Mg powder. EDX analysis confirms that both recycled powders retain their alloy-specific chemical compositions, but with increased oxygen content. XRD spectra peak analysis suggests that there are no phase change and no presence of any undesired precipitates in both recycled powders. Based on qualitative comparative analysis between the current results and from various available literature, the reuse of both recycled powders is acceptable up to 30 times, but re-evaluation through physical and chemical characterizations of the powders is advised, if they are to be subjected for further reuse.

The effect of metal EOS 316L stainless steel additive manufacturing powder recycling on part characteristics and powder reusability	ADVANCES IN MATERIALS AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; direct metal laser sintering; powder bed fusion; metal powder recycling; powder characteristics		Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is a powder bed fusion (PBF) process commonly used within the medical device and aerospace industries to fabricate high value, complex components. Powder material used in the DMLS process can be costly and it is rare for a single build to require a full batch of powder. The un-melted powder, which differs in particle size and morphology from virgin powder, is often recycled for further builds. This work presents a study of the effects that recycling a stainless steel metal powder used in the DMLS process has on finished parts. Hence, in this paper, powder material characteristics, such as particle size, particle morphology and bulk chemical composition have been monitored throughout the recycling process. An analysis of parts manufactured via DMLS on an EOS M280 demonstrate the negative effect of powder recycling on part quality in terms of surface roughness, part density, hardness and dimensional accuracy. Results from this research provide an insight to the effect that recycling AM powders has on the powder characteristics and on the quality of the parts produced.

J	Su, CY; Wang, JC; Chen, DS; Chuang, CC; Lin, CK				Su, Cherng-Yuh; Wang, Jia-Chang; Chen, Dong-Syu; Chuang, Cheng-Cho; Lin, Chung-Kwei			Additive manufacturing of dental prosthesis using pristine and recycled zirconia solvent-based slurry stereolithography	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Dental prosthesis; Zirconia; Recycled zirconia	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; IMPLANT; SURFACE; 3Y-TZP	Zirconia materials are widely used in digital dentistry due to their excellent properties. Although zirconia prostheses are typically prepared using computer-aided design and manufacturing, additive manufacturing technology can also be used. Both digital methods, however, may result in a large amount of residue zirconia. In the present study, solvent-based slurry stereolithography was used to prepare dental zirconia samples using either pristine or recycled zirconia powder. Characteristics of pristine zirconia, recycled powder, and as-prepared slurry were examined. Whereas, the 3D-printed objects using each material were built up with a layer thickness of either 20 or 40 mu m. Post heat treatment was performed to improve the mechanical properties. Density measurement, Vickers microhardness, and flexure strength of the sintered zirconia samples were investigated. Experimental results showed that the agglomeration of zirconia occurs in recycled powder and increases the viscosity of the slurry. The sintered zirconia samples exhibited a density higher than 99% when using the pristine powder and printed with a thickness of 20 mu m, whereas the recycled powder printed with 40 mu m thickness had a density slightly higher than 90%. The Vickers microhardness (similar to 1300 HV) was similar for sintered samples, but the flexure strength was significantly different. The flexure strength can reach up to 1057 MPa using pristine powder and printed with a layer thickness of 20 mu m, but decrease to 389 MPa when using recycled powder with 40 mu m layer thickness. The results suggest that 3D-printed zirconia using pristine powder can be used as dental prostheses, whereas 3D-printed zirconia using recycled powder may only be suitable for incisors or other applications.

Recycled rubber in the compressive strenght and bending of modified concrete with plasticizing admixtrue	REVISTA INGENIERIA DE CONSTRUCCION			English	Article						Rubber; concrete; strength; compression; bending	TIRE RUBBER	The use of concrete made with recycled materials allows an alternative in the optimization and considerable reduction of resources during the manufacturing process of the components. The resistance to compression and bending in concrete of 210 Kg/cm2 modified with plastifying additive at ages 7, 14 and 28 days were evaluated using recycled rubber of 5, 10 and 15% in its composition. Three experimental groups were included, with plasticizing admixture and recycled rubber, and two control groups, with and without plastifying additive. The resistance to compression reached maximum values of 218.45 Kg/cm2 and 212.33 Kg/cm2 at 5% and 10% rubber, respectively. As for the flexural strength, a maximum value of 81.86 Kg/cm2 was achieved for 10% rubber. The recycled rubber proved to be an excellent addition to be used in concrete mixtures despite the losses of mechanical strength, but by adding plastifying additive, it significantly improves making it possible to be incorporated into concrete up to 10%. By means of variance analysis with significance of 5%, it is concluded that the percentage of recycled rubber has a significant effect on the resistance to compression and bending in the manufacture of modified concrete with plastifying additive.

To achieve the desirable powder characteristics for additive manufacturing, the effect of ball size on the powder morphology change and particle size reduction was investigated through both theoretical analysis on the maximum deformation depth in the powder during ball milling and extensive experimental work. The modeling results suggest that large balls (diameter = 20 mm) efficiently break up machining chips to coarse powder particles while small balls (diameter = 6 mm) effectively modify the powder morphology to near-spherical. Therefore, a two-stage ball milling approach, i.e., using large balls at the initial stage of milling followed by a second stage of milling with small balls, was proposed in experiments and successfully converted machining chips to powders with near-spherical shape and particle sizes ranged from 38 to 150 pm. In addition, the nanoindentation hardness of the ball milled powder created from machining chips is 56% higher than the gas atomized powder. To verify the usability of the ball milled powder created from recycled machining chips in additive manufacturing, single tracks have been successfully deposited via laser engineered net shaping.

The demand for integrating MAM technology as a means to boosting sustainability in industry is based on its capacity to use smart or custom-designed materials to generate special geometries, unobtainable otherwise, allowing for further part optimisation or redesign. The outlined advantages and challenges of the new MAM processes and advanced technologies for functional objects and durable products underline the high interest in this area. Results from the literature and our MAM research interest indicate that some metal powder (MP) recycling and use/reuse technologies could be developed to save MP, as could MAM applications in component redesign and repairs to increase sustainability. The achievement has a high degree of generality and serves as a basis for future MAM sustainable methods.	[Daraban, Ana E. Oros; Negrea, Catalin S.; Artimon, Flavia G.

Milled polyester-glass waste was used as the recyclate. Polyester-glass composites with a specific content of recyclate were manufactured by means of manual laminating and vacuum bagging. The influence of the recyclate content and manufacturing method on the mechanical properties of composites was determined with the aid of specimens exposed to static tensile testing. Test results indicated that the composite without recyclate additive manufactured by means of vacuum bagging exhibits higher strength properties than the same composite manufactured by means of manual laminating. Additionally, its plasticity is much higher than that of the composite manufactured by means of manual laminating. The tests indicated that the tensile properties of the composite are, essentially, influenced by the content of recyclate (apart from the manufacturing method). Adding recyclate to the manufactured composite in the amount of 10% and 20% causes a significant decrease in its tensile properties in relation to the composite without the recyclate.

Particularly, those AM techniques which are used to manufacture metallic parts are of great interest to industry due to the good mechanical behaviour of metallic alloys. Despite this, the quality of the manufactured parts is still an important issue due to the wide range of parameters that can affect them. In some powder bed fusion techniques, such as Selective Laser Melting (SLM), not all the initially distributed metallic powder is used in the process. There is an unmolten portion that can be recycled to ensure both the economic and environmental viability of the process. Even though this powder is unmolten, it is thermally affected due to the high temperatures attained during the process. This fact affects the powder properties and, consequently, the properties of the manufactured parts. Therefore, an analysis of the recycling effects of SLM metallic powders is an important issue in order to establish good recycling procedures and to optimise the process performance.

An additive manufacturing solution to produce big green parts from tires and recycled plastics	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE AND INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING (RESIM 2016)	Procedia Manufacturing		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Sustainable and Intelligent Manufacturing (RESIM)	DEC 14-17, 2016	Leiria, PORTUGAL			Additive manufacturing; Recycled tires; Recycled plastics; Green parts	MANAGEMENT	Recycling is crucial for the conservation and improvement of the environment. The reduction of natural resource exploration and recovery of waste are examples of actions to contribute to a sustainable development. Waste from end-of-life tires and undifferentiated plastics represents an environmental problem due to the very high number of tons of used tires and plastics produced, but with a high economic potential because their incorporation into high value-added products is an issue of utmost importance. The manufacturing technologies oriented to the increase in quality levels, functional advantages, structural and financial gains of the produced products are currently a hot topic in industry. Similarly, the use of additive manufacturing technologies, instead of conventional techniques, e.g. moulding to process materials obtained from waste recovery, is a great industrial challenge. In order to promote greater environmental responsibility and to present innovative solutions for the management and sustainable destination of used waste recovery from tires and undifferentiated plastics, a composite made from the blend of 60% of tire waste granulate and 40% of polypropylene (PP) recycled was tested with the final purpose of generating components with added value. Both waste recovery materials were used in the micronized state. The thermal and mechanical behaviours of the synthesized composite were studied through DSC/TGA analysis and tensile testing. The implementation of additive manufacturing methodologies to process the blends between used tires granulated with a high incorporation of wastes from undifferentiated plastics was also explored in this work in order to produce big green parts without mould needed, such as urban furniture.

Consequently, low-cost 3D printers rose in the domestic environment, accelerating the development of startup companies and new market segments. Nevertheless, with regard to 3D printing based on fused filament fabrication, several challenges still need to be overcome, such as those related to surface finishing and mechanical strength. Moreover, 3D printing in the domestic environment also generates untreated plastic waste, which can cause environmental problems. For these reasons, the main goal of this work is to introduce and characterise 3D printing surface finishing post-processing using recycled plastic waste. As the main results of this work, the proposed recycling process was confirmed to improve object properties. Whereas surface roughness was reduced from 27 to 3 mu m, while mechanical strength was increased in 20 times. The application of recycled material for chemical welding was also seen to be feasible.

Large scale additive manufacturing of eco-composites	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIAL FORMING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Large-Scale; HDPE; Sawdust	3D; FABRICATION	The evolution of additive manufacturing processes is enabling the production of parts with improved dimensional accuracy, mechanical, physical and chemical properties [1]. New materials also contribute to this trend, and in this scope, eco-composites, materials with environmental and ecological advantages, which include natural polymers, have been acquiring increased relevance [2]. The purpose of this study is to develop composite material parts manufactured from recycled thermoplastics and natural fibres, in this case, wood residues. Additive manufacturing (fused deposition modelling) will be accomplished using a robot combined with extrusion unit. The objective is to access the influence of the main manufacturing parameters, such as temperature, distance between layers or deposition speed, on the final part characteristics, especially dimensional accuracy. Reverse engineering and several material analysis techniques will be employed to achieve this goal.	[Horta, J. F.; Simoes, F. J.

The production of AM parts with consistent and predictable properties requires input materials (e.g., metal powders) with known and repeatable characteristics, which in turn requires standardized measurement methods for powder properties. First, based on our previous work, we assess the applicability of current standardized methods for powder characterization for metal AM powders. Then we present the results of systematic studies carried out on two different powder materials used for additive manufacturing: stainless steel and cobalt-chrome. The characterization of these powders is important in NIST efforts to develop appropriate measurements and standards for additive materials and to document the property of powders used in a NIST-led additive manufacturing material round robin. An extensive array of characterization techniques was applied to these two powders, in both virgin and recycled states. The physical techniques included laser diffraction particle size analysis, X-ray computed tomography for size and shape analysis, and optical and scanning electron microscopy. Techniques sensitive to structure and chemistry, including X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive analytical X-ray analysis using the X-rays generated during scanning electron microscopy, and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy were also employed. The results of these analyses show how virgin powder changes after being exposed to and recycled from one or more Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) additive manufacturing build cycles. In addition, these findings can give insight into the actual additive manufacturing process.	[Slotwinski, J.

The image processing workflow was developed to process and analyze large amount of data objectively by computer program. The distribution of size and shape of the metal particles as well as defect (mainly porosity) inside the particles was analyzed with the statistical representation and resolution in micrometer. The result revealed that circular-shaped porosity with various sizes could be embedded in the powder particles. These porosities could potentially be transferred to the 3D printed part and critically affect the mechanical performance of the component. The present study shows the effectiveness of characterizing metal powders using x-ray imaging techniques where sufficient number of particles can be sampled within tens of minutes with a minimum sample preparation and high accuracy. Clear structural differences in the as-received and recycled powders were delineated that helps in determining the feasibility of using the recycled powders.

Mechanical properties and microstructures in zirconium deposited by injected powder laser additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Laser Cladding; Zirconium; Recycling powder; Laser additive manufacturing; Processing Parameters; Porosity	VARIABILITY; ALLOY	The use of laser additive manufacturing based on melting of injected zirconium powder under localized shielding was evaluated in terms of microstructures and mechanical properties of thin wall structures. The material was characterized in both the laser travel and the build directions. The microstructures, tensile properties and fracture behavior were assessed for deposits made using as-received and recycled powder. Electron back-scattered diffraction and transmission electron microcopy revealed a fine structure of Zr-alpha laths with nano-scale iron-rich precipitates at the lath interfaces. The properties of the fabricated components, which were made using new as-received powder were comparable to a Zr-2.5Nb alloy substrate, with yield strengths of over 569 MPa and uniform strains up to the ultimate tensile stress ranging from 8.5 to 9.9%. However, when recycled powder was used, the ductility dropped with total strains to failure of 1.0-7.5%, as a result of porosity and unmelted powder particles serving as brittle inclusions in the deposited material.

Open Source Filament Diameter Sensor for Recycling, Winding, and Additive Manufacturing Machines	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						additive manufacturing; advanced materials and processing; control and automation; process engineering; production systems optimization; sustainable manufacturing	LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYMER; VIRGIN; REPRAP; LOOP; POLYETHYLENE	To overcome the challenge of upcycling plastic waste into three-dimensional (3D) printing filament in the distributed recycling and additive manufacturing systems, this study designs, builds, tests, and validates an open-source filament diameter sensor for recycling and winding machines. The modular system for multi-axis optical control of the diameter of the recycled 3D-printer filament makes it possible to scan part of the surface of the processed filament, save the history of measurements along the entire length of the spool, as well as mark defective areas. The sensor is developed as an independent module and integrated into a recyclebot. It was tested on different kinds of polymers (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactide (PLA)), different sources of plastic, and different colors including clear plastic. The results were compared with the manual measurements, and the measurements obtained with a one-dimensional digital light caliper. The results found that the developed open-source filament sensing method allows users to obtain significantly more information in comparison with basic one-dimensional light sensors and using the received data not only for more accurate diameter measurements but also for a detailed analysis of the recycled filament surface. This could help to expand the use of plastic recycling technologies in the manufacturing community. The availability of tools for possible texture analysis could also stimulate the growth of composite materials creation. The presented system can greatly enhance the user possibilities and serve as a starting point for a complete recycling control system that will regulate motor parameters to achieve the desired filament diameter with acceptable deviations and even control the extrusion rate on a printer to recover from filament irregularities.

This paper shows the lifecycle of metal powder in additive manufacturing, investigating powder manufacture, powder usage, mechanisms of powder degradation and the usage of end-of-life powder. Degradation of powders resulting from repeated reuses was found to be a wide-spread problem; components produced from heavily reused powders are typically of a lower quality, eventually rendering the powder unusable in additive manufacturing. Powder degradation was found to be dependent on many variables, preventing the identification of a definitive end-of-life point for powders. The most accurate method of determining powder quality was found to be the production and analysis of components using these powders. Uses for degraded powder had not been previously identified in literature, warranting the investigation of potential solutions to prevent powder waste. Amongst other waste-reducing solutions, plasma spheroidisation was identified as a promising method to avoid powder disposal for approximately 12.5% of produced powders, creating particles similar to virgin powder from end-of-life powder. Returning end-of-life powders to the supplier for upcycling may be the only financially viable solution to reduce waste within the industry. The compilation of research within this paper aims to enable users of additive manufacturing to conduct further research and development into powder upcycling.

Recycled polyethylene terephthalate as a new FFF feedstock material	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						3D printing; Recycled plastics; Polyethylene terephthalate; FFF; Tensile; DMA; DSC	OF-THE-ART; TECHNOLOGIES; NANOFIBERS	Reclaimed materials such as waste plastics can be utilized in additive manufacturing to improve the self-reliance of war fighters on forward operating bases by cutting costs and decreasing the demand for the frequent resupplying of parts by the supply chain. In addition, the use of waste materials in additive manufacturing in the private sector would reduce cost and increase sustainability, providing a high-value output for used plastics. Experimentation is conducted to process polyethylene terephthalate bottles and packaging into filament that can then be used for additive manufacturing methods like fused filament fabrication, without the use of additives or modification to the polymer. The chemistry of different polyethylene terephthalate recycled feedstocks was evaluated and found to be identical, and thus mixed feedstock processing is a suitable approach. Rheological data showed drying of the recycled polyethylene terephthalate led to an increase in the polymer's viscosity. Thermal and mechanical properties were evaluated for filament with different processing conditions, as well as printed and molded specimens. Crystallinity ranged from 12.2 for the water cooled filament, compared to 24.9% for the filament without any active cooling. Tensile results show that the elongation to failure was similar to an injection molded part (3.5%) and tensile strength of 35.1 +/- 8 MPa was comparable to commercial polycarbonate-ABS filament, demonstrating the robustness of the material. In addition, three point bending tests showed a similar load at failure for a select long-lead military part printed from the recycled filament compared to parts printed from commercial filament. Thus filament from recycled polyethylene terephthalate has the capability for replacing commercial filament in printing a diverse range of plastic parts.

Sustainable Additive Manufacturing: Mechanical Response of Polyamide 12 over Multiple Recycling Processes	MATERIALS			English	Article						additive manufacturing (AM); three-dimensional (3D) printing; recycling; polyamide 12 (PA12); tensile test; flexural test; Charpy&#8217; s impact test; Vicker&#8217; s micro-hardness; scanning electron microscopy (SEM)		Plastic waste reduction and recycling through circular use has been critical nowadays, since there is an increasing demand for the production of plastic components based on different polymeric matrices in various applications. The most commonly used recycling procedure, especially for thermoplastic materials, is based on thermomechanical process protocols that could significantly alter the polymers' macromolecular structure and physicochemical properties. The study at hand focuses on recycling of polyamide 12 (PA12) filament, through extrusion melting over multiple recycling courses, giving insight for its effect on the mechanical and thermal properties of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) manufactured specimens throughout the recycling courses. Three-dimensional (3D) FFF printed specimens were produced from virgin as well as recycled PA12 filament, while they have been experimentally tested further for their tensile, flexural, impact and micro-hardness mechanical properties. A thorough thermal and morphological analysis was also performed on all the 3D printed samples. The results of this study demonstrate that PA12 can be successfully recycled for a certain number of courses and could be utilized in 3D printing, while exhibiting improved mechanical properties when compared to virgin material for a certain number of recycling repetitions. From this work, it can be deduced that PA12 can be a viable option for circular use and 3D printing, offering an overall positive impact on recycling, while realizing 3D printed components using recycled filaments with enhanced mechanical and thermal stability.

Recycling of such materials is mostly based on thermomechanical processes that significantly affect the mechanical, as well as the overall physicochemical properties of polymers. The study at hand focuses on the recyclability of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) 3D printed Polypropylene (PP) for a certain number of recycling courses (six in total), and its effect on the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts. Namely, 3D printed specimens were fabricated from non-recycled and recycled PP material, and further experimentally tested regarding their mechanical properties in tension, flexion, impact, and microhardness. Comprehensive dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, and morphological investigations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed for the different 3D printed PP samples. The overall results showed that there is an overall slight increase in the material's mechanical properties, both in tension and in flexion mode, while the DSC characterization indicates an increase in the polymer crystallinity over the recycling course.

Towards Distributed Recycling with Additive Manufacturing of PET Flake Feedstocks	MATERIALS			English	Article						polymers; recycling; waste plastic; upcycle; circular economy; PET; additive manufacturing; distributed recycling; distributed manufacturing; 3D printing	CIRCULAR ECONOMY; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYMER; REPRAP; POLYETHYLENE; VIRGIN; LOOP	This study explores the potential to reach a circular economy for post-consumer Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (rPET) packaging and bottles by using it as a Distributed Recycling for Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) feedstock. Specifically, for the first time, rPET water bottle flake is processed using only an open source toolchain with Fused Particle Fabrication (FPF) or Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF) processing rather than first converting it to filament. In this study, first the impact of granulation, sifting, and heating (and their sequential combination) is quantified on the shape and size distribution of the rPET flakes. Then 3D printing tests were performed on the rPET flake with two different feed systems: an external feeder and feed tube augmented with a motorized auger screw, and an extruder-mounted hopper that enables direct 3D printing. Two Gigabot X machines were used, each with the different feed systems, and one without and the latter with extended part cooling. 3D print settings were optimized based on thermal characterization, and both systems were shown to 3D print rPET directly from shredded water bottles. Mechanical testing showed the importance of isolating rPET from moisture and that geometry was important for uniform extrusion. The mechanical strength of 3D-printed parts with FPF and inconsistent flow is lower than optimized fused filament, but adequate for a wide range of applications. Future work is needed to improve consistency and enable water bottles to be used as a widespread DRAM feedstock.

Sustainable additive manufacturing: predicting binder jettability ofwater-soluble, biodegradable and recyclable polymers	POLYMER INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						additive manufacturing; binder jetting; sustainable manufacturing; polymers; recycling; circular economy	DRUG-DELIVERY; CERAMIC SUSPENSIONS; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; FIBER FORMATION; 3D; FABRICATION; BEHAVIOR; SIMULATION; GEOMETRIES; VISCOSITY	Additive manufacturing potentially generates customized polymeric objects with tailored geometry while reducing waste, employing biodegradable polymers and striving to use recyclable polymer feedstocks for a more sustainable future. Binder jetting additive manufacturing (BJ AM) creates 3D objects upon depositing liquid adhesive onto a powder bed, while a roller spreads powder over a build stage to form subsequent layers. Many factors affect jettability and printability including printhead design, binder material, binder solvent and powder characteristics. Material design for higher strength BJ AM parts using metals, ceramics or polymers exploits binders or particles that transform into thermosets or permanently shaped matrices through thermal or UV curing and sintering. While many BJ AM examples utilize biodegradable, water-soluble and recyclable polymers for biomedical and industrial applications, a wider array of opportunities exist to degrade, dissolve and reuse printed materials. Systematically shifting to these polymers will facilitate reuse and recycling of both binders and powders, but more studies to improve part strength are required. This review describes an overview of polymer jettability and a perspective into opportunities currently underutilized in transitioning BJ AM into a more sustainable AM platform.

Additive manufactured textiles for high-performance stab resistant applications	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Textile technology; Protective clothing; Advanced manufacturing technologies; Laser sintering; High-performance; Stab resistant; Additive manufactured textile; Body armour; Home Office Scientific Development Branch; United Kingdom		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the stab resistance characteristics of a series of planar and articulated laser sintered (LS) samples, in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) Body Armour Standard - Publication 39/07. Design/methodology/approach - A series of LS planar samples were manufactured using an EOS P100 Formiga system, manufactured from 100 per cent virgin or a 50:50 mix of recycled and virgin Nylon (PA2200), ranging in thickness from 1-10 mm. All planar samples were stab tested to the HOSDB knife-resistance (KR) level one impact energy of 24 Joules, using an in-house manufactured HOSDB guided rail drop test impact rig and standardised knives. Penetration through the underside of each sample was measured and recorded. These results were then used to develop an articulated, additive manufactured (AM) scale textile - LS from a 50:50 mix of recycled and virgin PA2200 powder. These samples were then tested using the aforementioned impact rig and stab impact energy. Findings - The research demonstrated that while virgin PA2200 sample required a minimum thickness of 8 nnm to achieve stab-resistance below the HOSDB maximum penetration limit of 7 mm, this figure can be reduced to 5.6 mm when manufacturing LS planar samples from a 50:50 mix of virgin and recycled PA2200. Results from stab testing the articulated samples indicated a successful AM textile-like design, with a maximum knife penetration of 1.6 mm - below the 7 mm HOSDB limit. Originality/value - The paper describes a unique application of AM technologies for the manufacture of high-performance stab resistant AM textiles.

J	Chawla, K; Singh, R; Singh, J				Chawla, Kapil; Singh, Rupinder; Singh, Jaspreet			On recyclability of thermoplastic ABS polymer as fused filament for FDM technique of additive manufacturing	WORLD JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						Additive manufacturing; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Melt flow index; Fused deposition modeling; Twin-screw extruder		Purpose The thermoplastic polymers do not decompose easily due to the presence of long-chain stable polymeric structure, and thus, causes serious effects on the environment. Recycling of these polymer wastes becomes the only solution to minimize their adverse effects on the environment. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of using recycled thermoplastic material as filament for fused deposition modeling technique. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the researchers fabricated fused filaments (in-house) for fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique of additive manufacturing from secondary recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) by using a twin-screw extruder. After measuring the melt flow index of the secondary recycled ABS, the twin-screw extrusion parameters (rpm/speed of the screw, extrusion temperature and load) were varied to predict their influence on the various properties (rheological/mechanical/thermal) of the fabricated filaments. Experimental work was executed as per Taguchi's L9 orthogonal array. Findings Thermal analysis performed to estimate the heat carrying capacity of recycled ABS highlighted that the heat capacity of ABS increases significantly from 0.28 J/g to 3.94 J/g during the heating cycle. The maximum value of peak strength and percentage break elongation for the fused filaments was investigated at 12.5 kg load, 2,250 C extrusion temperature and 70 rpm speed. Originality/value The filaments fabricated by recycling the polymeric waste has been successfully used in the FDM machine for the preparation of the three-dimensional printed tensile specimen.

Mechanical Properties and Applications of Recycled Polycarbonate Particle Material Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing	MATERIALS			English	Article						3D printing; additive manufacturing; distributed manufacturing; polymers; polycarbonate; recycling; waste plastic; extruder; upcycle; circular economy	WASTE POLYMER; LARGE-SCALE; 3D; SYSTEM; FILAMENT; REPRAP; POLYETHYLENE; DESIGN	Past work has shown that particle material extrusion (fused particle fabrication (FPF)/fused granular fabrication (FGF)) has the potential for increasing the use of recycled polymers in 3D printing. This study extends this potential to high-performance (high-mechanical-strength and heat-resistant) polymers using polycarbonate (PC). Recycled PC regrind of approximately 25 mm(2) was 3D printed with an open-source Gigabot X and analyzed. A temperature and nozzle velocity matrix was used to find useful printing parameters, and a print test was used to maximize the output for a two-temperature stage extruder for PC. ASTM type 4 tensile test geometries as well as ASTM-approved compression tests were used to determine the mechanical properties of PC and were compared with filament printing and the bulk virgin material. The results showed the tensile strength of parts manufactured from the recycled PC particles (64.9 MPa) were comparable to that of the commercial filament printed on desktop (62.2 MPa) and large-format (66.3 MPa) 3D printers. Three case study applications were investigated: (i) using PC as a rapid molding technology for lower melting point thermoplastics, (ii) printed parts for high temperature applications, and (iii) printed parts for high-strength applications. The results show that recycled PC particle-based 3D printing can produce high-strength and heat-resistant products at low costs.

As the focus of metal AM is shifting from prototyping to large-scale production, cutting the cost of AM powder remains a major priority. The metal LPBF process is likely to be more economical if feedstock powders are reusable without sacrificing the physical and mechanical properties of final parts. This work introduces the use of dosage to study powder recycling without adding any virgin powder to the feeder. To understand the effects of powder recycling in LPBF of 17-4 PH stainless steel powders, this work studies the properties of both recycled powders and the printed parts after ten successive prints. Powder rheology, morphology, microstructure, and chemical compositions are investigated to study the effect of recycling. Compared to virgin powder, the average particle size increased slightly while powder flowability decreased significantly in the recycled powders. The effect of powder recycling on the microstructure, chemical composition, porosity, roughness and tensile properties of printed parts are also investigated. Compared to the Print 1, samples printed in the Print 10 showed an increase in pore size (54 %) and surface roughness at the Top surface (17 %) resulting in a similar to 7 % reduction in ductility.

Optimal pricing of 3D printing platform and material suppliers in a closed-loop competitive circular supply chain	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Closed-loop supply chain, 3D printing platform; Product quality differentiation; Circular economy; Industry 4.0	SPARE PARTS; POLYETHYLENE; POLYMER; ECONOMY; IMPACT; MAINTENANCE; FUTURE	Three-dimensional printing (3DP) or additive manufacturing is regarded as an environmentally friendly and sustainable form of manufacturing, which allows circular manufacturing as the 3D printed waste and products can be recycled for further 3DP operations. Due to the fact that the reclaimed material is commonly perceived to have poorer quality than the virgin material, the pricing of materials and printed products are crucial for consumers to decide their printing and material selection decisions. We consider a closed-loop competitive circular supply chain comprising (1) a 3DP platform that provides 3DP services to print products from virgin and recycled materials, (2) material suppliers that provide virgin and recycled materials (filaments) for the platform, and (3) end users who use the platform to print their products. We derive the prices, demands, and profits of the 3DP platform and material suppliers in Stackelberg equilibrium. We also conduct numerical studies using real-life data to generate practical insights from the analytical findings. Most interestingly, we find that while the platform prefers, both types of suppliers avoid, printing high-quality products from recycled material. We derive management insights and policy implications from the analytical and numerical findings for the closed-loop competitive circular supply chain.

The approach consists in producing new parts directly from existing components avoiding the material recycling stage, using a combination of additive and subtractive technologies. The proposed approach seems able to reduce resources consumption and waste during the manufacturing process. The major steps of the approach are presented. The process planning for combined additive and subtractive processes is particularly discussed. The process planning is designed through the feature concept, based on the knowledge of individual processes, technological requirements, and available resources. Finally, the feasibility of proposed approach is validated through a case study. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Currently, additive manufacturing have been applied for many industries such as for automotive, aerospace, medical and other commercial product. The technologies are supported by materials for the manufacturing process to produce high quality product. Plus, additive manufacturing technologies has been growth from the lowest to moderate and high technology to fulfil manufacturing industries obligation. Initially from simple 3D printing such as fused deposition modelling (FDM), poly-jet, inkjet printing, to selective laser sintering (SLS), and electron beam melting (EBM). However, the high technology of additive manufacturing nowadays really needs high investment to carry out the process for fine products. There are three foremost type of material which is polymer, metal and ceramic used for additive manufacturing application, and mostly they were in the form of wire feedstock or powder. In circumstance, it is crucial to recognize the characteristics of each type of materials used in order to understand the behaviours of the materials on high temperature application via additive manufacturing. Therefore, this review aims to provide excessive inquiry and gather the necessary information for further research on additive material materials for high temperature application. This paper also proposed a new material based on powder glass, which comes from recycled tempered glass from automotive industry, having a huge potential to be applied for high temperature application. The technique proposed for additive manufacturing will minimize some cost of modelling with same quality of products compare to the others advanced technology used for high temperature application.

The positive impact of Additive Manufacturing on sustainability is more evident for those mass consumption products that are characterized by a short lifecycle. Nevertheless, in order to take full advantage of these technologies and let them achieve their full potential, a great change is needed in the behaviour and attitude of consumers. Compromises may be necessary to accommodate technological limitations, and customers may need to prioritize between functional and aesthetic product characteristics. The positive impact of additive manufacturing on sustainability is more evident for those mass consumption products that are characterized by a short lifecycle. The material flow and sustainability of 3D printing are described in this paper for the manufacturing of mobile case covers, and compared to those of mass production injection moulding.

On the tolerable limits of granulated recycled material additives to maintain structural integrity	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						Particles; Composites; Additive manufacturing; Recycling; Phase averages		Production and maker spaces are increasingly generating mixed plastic material waste of varying quality from 3-D printers. Industrial interest is growing in embedding granulated recycled particulate material additives into a virgin binding matrix. Examples include the introduction of granulated mixed recycled materials into 3-D printer material, concrete, and pavement. The stress load-sharing between the particulate additive and the binding matrix is an important factor in design and development of these composite materials. With mixed material additives, a designer is interested in the variation of such predicted load-sharing. However, experimental development is costly and time-consuming, thus analytical and semi-analytical estimates are desired for accelerated development. In this work, we expand on previous analytically correlated phase-averaged micro- and macrostructural loading to include variational effects present in mixed recycled material. In addition, model trade-offs are provided to aid designers in quickly selecting application specific mixtures. This framework identifies the stress contributions, and their variation, to reduce product development time and costs, which could greatly accelerate material recycling and reuse for improved infrastructure materials, low-cost 3-D printer filament, and reduced waste towards a more circular economy.

Recycled Cellulose Polypropylene Composite Feedstocks for Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							STATE SHEAR PULVERIZATION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COUPLING AGENTS; MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE; THERMAL-EXPANSION; FILLER CONTENT; FIBER; POLYETHYLENE; POLYMER; BEHAVIOR	Many types of consumer-grade packaging can be used in material extrusion additive manufacturing processes, providing a high-value output for waste plastics. However, many of these plastics have reduced mechanical properties and increased warpage/shrinkage compared to those commonly used in three-dimensional (3D) printing. The addition of reinforcing materials can lead to stiffer parts with reduced distortion. This paper presents work in the reinforcement of recycled polypropylene using cellulose waste materials to generate a green composite feedstock for extrusion-based polymer additive manufacturing. Recycled polypropylene/waste paper, cardboard, and wood flour composites were made using a solid-state shear pulverization process. Fourier transform infrared and thermogravimetric analysis were utilized to qualitatively analyze the amount of filler incorporated into the 3D-printed materials. Recycled polymer composites had increased levels of filler incorporated in the printed parts compared to the virgin polymer composites based on the thermal gravimetric analysis. The dynamic mechanical analysis showed a ca. 20-30% increase in storage modulus with the addition of cellulose materials. Tensile strength was not significantly increased with the addition of 10 wt % cellulose, but the elastic modulus increased 38% in virgin polypropylene. The analysis of fracture surfaces revealed that failure initiates at the interface, suggesting that the interfacial strength is weaker than the filler strength.

In order to decrease the cost of powder production and increase the recycling rate of the turnings, the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation (HDH) process has been utilised. The HDH process consists of the following sequence: surface conditioning of the turnings, hydrogenation, ball milling (for powder production), and dehydrogenation. Afterwards, the properties of the recycled powder were analysed via phase, chemical, and morphological examinations, and size and flowability measurements. Usability of the powder in additive manufacturing applications has been evaluated via examining the characteristics of the deposit produced from this powder by the cold spray method. In short, promising results were obtained regarding the potential of the recycled powders in additive manufacturing after making minor adjustments in the HDH process.

J	Le, VT; Paris, H; Mandil, G				Van Thao Le; Paris, Henri; Mandil, Guillaume			Environmental impact assessment of an innovative strategy based on an additive and subtractive manufacturing combination	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Life cycle assessment; End-of-life product; Additive manufacturing; CNC machining; Remanufacturing	OF-LIFE STRATEGIES; SUSTAINABILITY; DESIGN; ENERGY; TOOL; EVOLUTION; FRAMEWORK; PARTS	Recently, the combination of additive and subtractive manufacturing technologies is gaining significant attention from both the industrial and academic sectors. Due to consolidated advantages of individual techniques, this combination provides the capability of producing innovative products, and opens new perspectives for developing new remanufacturing/manufacturing strategies. In this paper, an innovative strategy is proposed. The strategy aims to manufacture a new part directly from an EoL part (or existing part), using a sequence of additive and subtractive manufacturing processes. The existing part is transformed into the new part without involving the material recycling phase. This paper particularly focuses on the environmental assessment of the proposed strategy. For this purpose, a methodology based on the life cycle assessment method is developed. The environmental trade-offs between the proposed strategy and the conventional strategy are also discussed through the case study. The conventional strategy uses conventional processes (such as material recycling, casting and machining) to manufacture the new part, whereas the proposed strategy is based on combining electron beam melting (EBM) and CNC machining processes. The results show that the proposed strategy becomes more environmentally friendly when the material volume of existing part reused increases more than 60%. The proposed methodology can help designers and manufacturers to select the most suitable strategy to manufacture new parts from existing parts with minimum environmental impacts.

This situation often involves the renovation of the surface's layers. It is, therefore, urgent to appeal to a new vision of pavement design based on optimizing the use of local materials, nonrenewable, and respect for the environment. The recycling of bituminous substances is one of the relevant solutions. It has the advantage of reusing building materials by mixing them with a proportion of refined ones to achieve the required performance. This assignment researches for different rates of coated aggregates, the effects of manufacturing temperature and blending time in the mixing of the constituents during production as well as the additive (powder of rubber) on the improvement of the recycled asphalt rutting. Rutting is one of the most encountered degradation phenomena in the Algerian roads. The formulated hypothesis used here assumes that the additive has an influence on the mechanical performance (rutting) of the recycled asphalt and also on the rate of the used asphalt aggregates. To justify this hypothesis, it is mandatory to go through the manufacture of the asphalt with different rate of asphalt aggregates. To reduce the number of experimental tests necessary for this study, we used the experimental approaches method ANOVA.

The deposition process is very complex, and the correlation between physical properties of powder and performance of specimens manufactured has not been fully revealed. So the objective of this paper is to investigate the recyclability of 316L stainless steel powder used by LDED. The morphology, particle size distribution and surface phase composition of the standard and recycled powder were compared. The micro-hardness and mechanical property of different components were also tested. The results show that under the multiple effects from laser, powder was gradually coarsened, the proportion of irregularly shaped particles increased and the elements content of surface were slightly changed. But the surface phase composition did not transform. Microstructure of specimens fabricated by recycled powder was coarser, some internal metallurgical defects appeared and a decrease in plasticity occurred. However, little difference in the micro-hardness and tensile strength was found for samples fabricated by virgin and recycled powder.

Several demanded components are obtained in disassembly center and the remaining amounts are produced by 3D printer en-route. We formulate a non-linear mathematical programming model for the I-DLB-RP-MAM. We conduct experiments on a numerical examplebased on a real product. Scenario analysis is conducted and results show that additive manufacturing technology can be successfully incorporated into the supply chain. We obtain significant improvements such as reduction in inventory and total cost.

J	Romani, A; Rognoli, V; Levi, M				Romani, Alessia; Rognoli, Valentina; Levi, Marinella			Design, Materials, and Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing in Circular Economy Contexts: From Waste to New Products	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						product design; additive manufacturing; circular materials; material recycling; recycling and reuse; design for sustainability; 3D printing	COMPOSITES	The transition toward circular economy models has been progressively promoted in the last few years. Different disciplines and strategies may significantly support this change. Although the specific contribution derived from design, material science, and additive manufacturing is well-established, their interdisciplinary relationship in circular economy contexts is relatively unexplored. This paper aims to review the main case studies related to new circular economy models for waste valorization through extrusion-based additive manufacturing, circular materials, and new design strategies. The general patterns were investigated through a comprehensive analysis of 74 case studies from academic research and design practice in the last six-year period (2015-2021), focusing on the application fields, the 3D printing technologies, and the materials. Further considerations and future trends were then included by looking at the relevant funded projects and case studies of 2021. A broader number of applications, circular materials, and technologies were explored by the academic context, concerning the practice-based scenario linked to more consolidated fields. Thanks to the development of new strategies and experiential tools, academic research and practice can be linked to foster new opportunities to implement circular economy models.

With increasing concerns about global sustainability, eco-consideration is highly encouraged to be integrated into AM processes. This review provides a comprehensive and timely discussion on the life cycle of metal parts fabricated through AM. The energy consumption required for raw metal material extraction and subsequent AM processes is analyzed. The eco-design and energy efficiency of metal AM are evaluated to reveal the role of manufacturing methods, machine subsystems, and post-processing modes in the eco-integration. AM-induced supply chain management, utilization, and recycling of the printed metal structure are also analyzed. Finally, a comprehensive life cycle assessment regarding the environmental, social, and economic impacts of metal AM is also addressed. Future directions of AM are also briefly discussed to provide insight and vision on the emerging field of additive eco-manufacturing.

It is one of the flexible manufacturing technique that can apply to polymers, metals, ceramics, concrete, and composites. Owing to the ability to select from a wide range of processible polymers and the enhancement in some of the properties offered by polymers, the AM industry, still predominantly targets the production of polymeric components. This review demonstrates the current state of AM industry regarding polymeric materials. A brief explanation of the additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, polymers, and polymer composites (fibre reinforces, particle reinforced and nanocomposites) utilised in the AM processes is provided. Polymer AM is being applied in different applications such as biomedical, electronics, aerospace, automobile, and sporting industries respectively. The review also emphasizes the rising importance of antimicrobial polymers in the COVID-19 pandemic. The exponential use of polymeric materials in the industrial sector has caused an increase in wastage generation and disposal issues which draws attention to the importance of green composites as well as life cycle assessment (LCA) of products and processes. Finally, the significance of Distributed Recycling via AM due to the disposal issues and low polymer recycling rates is illustrated. ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, the European Space Agency has started to develop its own expertise on powder characterisation within its UK-based Advanced Manufacturing Laboratory, in close collaboration with the European Space Research and Technology Centre. In this paper, a detailed study on the testing methods for determining powder and particle properties will be presented as well as storage and recycling considerations. Currently recognized standard procedures for metal powder characterisation will be critically reviewed. The developed testing methodology will be illustrated on a variety of powder samples.This study is part of a broader initiative that aims to support the establishment of a healthy powder supply chain for additive manufacturing, ensuring reliable and consistent powder feedstock for the space sector.

The materials were tested in three-point bending, and the incorporation of the additives always produced a decrease of the flexural strength. The results obtained were compared with the properties of commercially available materials. In particular, PP + PE blends showed a promising mechanical performance. For the amount of flame-retardant additive used in this study, none of the compositions analyzed exhibited flame resistance. The balance between loss of mechanical strength due to the increase of the amount of flame retardant additive and lack of flame resistance was obtained by incorporating more flame retardant through a paintinglike procedure. The method proved to be an efficient way to attend the standard for building construction panels.

The chosen material is intended for injection molding and especially for the production of products made by additive technologies. Experimental verification of the mechanical properties was realized by testing samples produced with various concentrations of the recycled material. Experimental samples underwent tests to obtain the mechanical properties of the produced new material. These tests included rheological tests, tensile and flexural tests as well as and Charpy impact toughness tests. These mechanical tests were conducted according to ISO standards valid for the individual testing method. Testing methods were carried out using prescribed numbers of testing samples. The presented scientific article is also focused on changes in microstructures of testing materials in relation to the percentage ratio of recycled granulate. Recycled granulate of thermoplastic was not necessity for additional modifications.

In laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF), powder is often recycled due to its high cost. However, there is no comprehensive study on how powder recycling affects its rheological properties, as well as the mechanical and fatigue behavior of the manufactured part. This study compares powder characteristics and mechanical performance of as-built and machined specimens fabricated from new and heavily used Ti-6Al-4V powder. Powder characteristics include particle size distribution and morphology, flowability, apparent density, compressibility, thermal conductivity, oxygen concentration, and more. Results indicate that particle size distribution becomes narrower and flowability increases with recycling. Not a significant effect of recycling was observed on the monotonic tensile and fatigue behavior of specimens in the as-built surface condition. However, machined specimens fabricated from used powder demonstrated longer fatigue lives in the high cycle regime.

These issues highlight the need for a dramatically more efficient use of natural resources to create social and economic value for society while respecting the carrying capacity limits of the planet. Additive manufacturing technologies provide opportunities to support sustainable manufacturing and the circular economy paradigm. These opportunities can be leveraged throughout the product lifecycle: energy and material consumption reduction in manufacturing, lower material use through maintenance, reuse, remanufacturing and recycling. Despite these benefits being more broadly recognised in recent years, industrial applications are still scarce. This work proposes a quantitative methodology to assess the circularities arising along the lifecycle of a product fabricated with additive manufacturing technologies, thereby supporting the shift to more circular industrial systems and sustainability.

AM enables the fabrication of innumerable 3D geometries that cannot be easily produced by other means. In spite of the great promise of AM as an advanced form of future manufacturing, there are still fundamental challenges with respect to sustainability that need to be addressed. Some of the material needs for AM include sustainable sources of printing inks, resins, and filaments, as well as pathways for polymer recycling, upcycling, and chemical circularity. Furthermore, the combination of biosourced and biodegradable polymers with additive manufacturing could enable the fabrication of objects that can be recycled back into feedstock or degraded into nontoxic products after they have served their function.

This requires introducing smart and personalised drug delivery systems with controlled release profile manufactured using novel approaches. Additive manufacturing (AM) provides opportunities such as full customisation, design freedom, and on-site manufacturing, and materials recycling. As a result, the academic and industrial demand for additive manufacturing for drug delivery has been continuously increasing and showing impressive results for a wide range of products. This paper provides an extensive overview of AM technologies and their applications for drug delivery. The review discusses AM technologies including their working principles, processed materials, as well as current progress in drug delivery to produce personalized dosages for every patient with controlled release profile. AM potentials, industrial scale, and challenges are investigated with regards to practice and industrial applications. The paper covers novel possibilities of AM technologies and their pharmaceuticals applications, which indicate a promising healthcare future.

High-speed imaging of droplet behaviour during the CYCLAM drop-deposition technique	17TH NORDIC LASER MATERIALS PROCESSING CONFERENCE (NOLAMP17)	Procedia Manufacturing		English	Proceedings Paper	17th Nordic Laser Materials Processing Conference (NOLAMP)	AUG 27-29, 2019	Trondheim, NORWAY	SINTEF Ind, Dept Mat Integr & Welding		laser additive manufacturing; circular economy; high-speed imaging; laser cladding; recycling		The material in laser additive manufacturing is traditionally supplied in the form of powder or sometimes wire. A technique called CYCLAM was recently presented which is a fast and direct recycling technique which lowers the number of steps that need to be taken in typical recycling, allowing for a more circular economy. The CYCLAM technique proposes that waste metal is directly recycled through laser cutting or laser ablation of one sheet and the molten droplet is directly deposited onto a new product and can be used for additive manufacturing or cladding. The technique also can also use materials that otherwise are not available as powder or wires. Because of the novelty of the technique, it is still scarcely studied, and many aspects still needs to be understood. This paper focusses on high-speed imaging of the technique to understand the droplet behaviour. The material removal of the feeding sheet was done with Remote Fusion Cutting. Different power levels lead to different drop geometry and flight pattern of the drops where the drops at higher power are pushed further forward. The influence of the laser power on the shape of the deposited track can be seen from cross sections of the cladded track where higher power means that more power is transmitted through the feeding sheet and onto the substrate which creates a smoother surface (C) 2019 The Authors.

A wide variety of materials can be used to produce a variety of shapes that cannot be achieved using any other technology. AM started as a prototyping in plastics, and now it is successfully implemented with metals. AM in metals, first of all, in Titanium alloys, offers the potential to not only generate net-shape, complex geometrical and light-weight objects, but also to achieve enhanced mechanical properties, even better than achieved by traditional mass production, like casting. However, the priority of achieving good non-porous microstructure and the desired mechanical properties is a challenge for the main fields of applications of Titanium AM, such as the aerospace industry and production of medical implants. Thus, the quality of the powder and standardization of the AM process are the top priority. The potential recycling of the Ti-6Al-4 V powder as an inextricable part of the AM process needs to be explored. The influence of powder recycling on Ti-6Al-4 V additive manufacturing, the correct number of cycles, the requirements of the recycling procedures, and possible post processing procedures - are still open questions. This research aims to answer these questions. Two identical test cylinder sets were printed, one from recycled powder and one from the new powder batch. The cylinders were printed by the Arcam EBM A2X machine using a start platform of 210 x 210 mm in size. Electron Beam Melting (EBM) is a well-known effective manufacturing process. This AM technology utilizes high power electron beam to produce layer-by-layer metal parts for various applications, such as fabrication of biomedical implants and aerospace components. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the printed specimens from the two sets (new and recycled Ti-6Al-4 V powder) were investigated before and after heat treatment.

The results revealed that the particle size distribution (PSD) for the selective laser melting (SLM) process is typically in the range from 15 mu m to 63 mu m. The flow rate of virgin Inconel powder is around 28 s.(50 g)(-1). In addition, the packing density was found to be 60%. The rheological test results indicate that the virgin powder has reasonably good flowability compared with the recycled powder. The inter-relation between the powder characteristics is discussed herein. A propeller was successfully printed using the powder. The results suggest that Inconel powder is suitable for AM and can be a good reference for researchers who attempt to produce AM powders. (C) 2017 THE AUTHORS.

Thanks to this technology, viscous inks are easily extruded for the creation of 3D structures. Nevertheless, the quick recovery of the solid-like behavior after extrusion remains one of the most crucial open issues for 3D-printable inks. The main goal herein is to improve the printability of a UV-curable thermosetting composite ink reinforced with mechanically recycled glass fiber composites by modifying its rheological behavior. The overall process is optimized, leading to the definition of the optimal extrusion parameters for these types of materials. Furthermore, the retraction mode is successfully developed for the DIW of recycled composites. Additional features are achieved, thanks to the aforementioned improvements, such as 3D complex shapes, assembled pieces, and/or moving built-in mechanisms, increasing the number of new potential applications of recycled glass fiber-reinforced polymers.

These systems selectively extrude/deposit polymers to manufacture parts directly from computational designs. Therefore, FDM enables conversion of recycled thermoplastic polymers to higher quality products. However, FDM induces porosity, which reduces mechanical performance and causes variations in mechanical properties of fused deposition modeled (FDMed) polymers. A safe and reliable use of FDMed-recycled polymers demands a better understanding of the effect of recycling on the mechanical properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of three rounds of recycling on the stochastic mechanical properties of FDMed ABS. A total of 337 tensile tests were performed on FDMed virgin and recycled ABS. Recycling increased the porosity of FDMed ABS from similar to 11 vol% to similar to 17 vol %. The tensile and fracture strength decreased by similar to 10%. The strain at break decreased by 25% from 5.2% to 3.9%, causing a decrease in toughness by 37%. We observed significant variations in the mechanical properties, which were analyzed using Weibull statistics. An S-type deviation from Weibull distribution was observed for strength variations that was related to porosity. Minimal degradation in ABS molecular structure was observed via gel permeation chromatography, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy revealed an increase in elemental iron with recycling. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This trend has produced an interest in recycled filaments, both to reduce the manufacturing cost of fabricated products and to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Also, this recycling system is very useful to make functional filament such as highly conducting or high strength filament by combining carbon nanotube or polydopamine during recycling process. This study presents the design procedures of system for making recycled filaments for 3D printers from waste polymer. The system integrates four main parts for recycling filament: a shredder, which crushes polymer waste into small pieces; an extruder, which extrudes filament from the crushed pieces; a sensing and control component, which regulates the diameter of the extruded filament via a closed-loop control system, and a spooler. Additionally, the dimensional accuracy, the mechanical strength of pristine, and recycled filaments were investigated and compared.

J	Anderson, I				Anderson, Isabelle			Mechanical Properties of Specimens 3D Printed with Virgin and Recycled Polylactic Acid	3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						PLA; recycling; mechanical properties; 3D printing; additive manufacturing	3-D; PARAMETERS; IMPACT; PLA	With the 26% annual growth rate of additive manufacturing, especially in the area of 3D polymer printing, the amount of waste is increasing at a rapid rate. Limited research in the area of recycling has been produced, yet there are several recycling machines being developed for home use. Despite this work there is no published mechanical data on components produced with filament recycled from 3D printed parts. There is very limited data on mechanical properties of any 3D printed materials. This article compares the properties of parts 3D printed with virgin polylactic acid (PLA) to those printed with recycled PLA. Using commercially available PLA and an entry level 3D printer, tensile and shear specimens were produced and then tested for tensile yield strength, modulus of elasticity, shear yield strength, and hardness. The specimens were then ground up and re-extruded into filament, and a second set of specimens were produced and tested using this recycled PLA filament. Mechanical testing showed that 3D printing with recycled PLA is a viable option. With the recycled filament, tensile strength decreased 10.9%, shear strength increased 6.8%, and hardness decreased 2.4%. The tensile modulus of elasticity was statistically unchanged. Although the average mechanical properties before and after recycling were similar, there was more variability in the results of the recycled filament. Additionally, when printing with the recycled filament there was some nozzle clogging, while none occurred with the virgin filament. Overall, the mechanical properties of specimens 3D printed from recycled PLA filament were similar to virgin properties, encouraging further development in the area of recycling 3D printed filament.

Development of new lubricating grease formulations using recycled LDPE as rheology modifier additive	EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL			English	Article						lubricating grease; additive; polyethylene; recycled polymer; rheology; microstructure	MICROSTRUCTURE; PLASTICS; FLOW	The recovery of plastic waste but also its applicability in product development may be an incentive to industry, since the use of such plastics represents a cheaper source of raw material. The aim of the present paper is to study the feasibility of recycling polyolefins as additives to improve the rheological properties of lithium 12-hydroxystearate lubricating greases. The effects that both soap and recycled low-density polyethylene (LDPE) concentration exert on the rheology of lithium lubricating greases and its relationship with grease microstructure are discussed in this work. In this way, different lubricating grease formulations were manufactured by modifying the concentration of lithium 12-hydroxystearate and content of recycled LDPE, according to a RSM statistical design. These lubricating greases were rheologically characterized through small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and viscous flow measurements. In addition to these, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) observations and mechanical stability tests were also carried out. Recycled LDPE was found to be an effective additive to modify grease rheology, acting as filler in the soap entangled microstructure. The values of both apparent viscosity and viscoelastic functions in the linear viscoelastic region increase with soap and recycled polymer concentrations. However, the addition of recycled LDPE distort the microstructural network of these greases resulting greases with less relative elastic characteristics and poorer mechanical properties as LDPE content increases.

There has been important progress in this area, with an increasing number of papers that cover diverse environmental aspects, including the circular economy, recycling and the life cycle assessment of materials. This increase is due to the importance that scientists, industry, government and society are now giving to these topics. This review seeks to develop a greater awareness in relation to the possibilities and implications in the use of the AM, as well as to encourage sustainable development by raising awareness in relation to the taking of necessary actions to achieve compliance of the Sustainable Development Goals. Similarly, current trends are examined in relation to the practices that are currently being adopted in order to ensure that AM is consolidated as a sustainable and convenient practice in the economic, social and environmental spheres. In general, polymers, ceramics, metals and composite materials are now undergoing intensive research to improve their use. Although this research shows that significant progress has been made on several relevant issues, using materials optimization to minimize energy and waste is still far from a global solution.

However the various polymer, metallic and composite feedstocks used within additive manufacturing are mainly derived from energy consuming, inefficient methods, often originating from non-sustainable sources. This work explores the mechanical properties of additively manufactured composite structures fabricated from recycled sustainable wood waste with the aim of enhancing mechanical properties through glass fibre reinforcement. In the first instance, samples were formed by pouring formulation of wood waste (wood flour) and thermosetting binder (urea formaldehyde), with and without glass fibres, into a mould. The same formulations were used to additively manufacture samples via a layered deposition technique. Samples manufactured using each technique were cured and subsequently tested for their mechanical properties. Additively manufactured samples had superior mechanical properties, with up to 73% increase in tensile strength compared to moulded composites due to a densification of feedstock/paste and fibre in-situ directional alignment.

Often, numerous materials are mixed with cement in the form of powders (that are mainly supplementary cementitious materials), fillers or others, to enhance the properties and applicability of concrete produced. In the last two decades, additive manufacturing has grown rapidly; however, large amounts of waste metal powder from additive manufacturing were generated at the same time. Metal powders are generally expensive, and recycling of such metal powder causes associated hazards and environmental stress. Incorporating metal powder into cementitious system may be a solution to utilize metal powders from the additive manufacturing industry and to improve the mechanical strength of cement part at the same time. In this study, a non-conventional Stainless Steel (SS) micropowder, of particle size 40100?mu m was used in cement paste mixture. SS powder is a new material to be used in the cementitious matrix that has not been reported in the literature to the best of authors knowledge. Properties of SS micropowder modified cement paste samples were characterized and compared to that of a control (reference) mixture. The results indicated that addition of 5% SS micropowder to cement paste (by volume of the mixture) was an optimum quantity that improved the strength and durability of the mixture whereas 2 and 8% SS addition had negative effects. Further study to explore its use at higher dosages as replacement of cement is recommended. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recycling of additively printed rare-earth bonded magnets	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Recycling; Bonded magnets; Cryomilling; Waste management; Additive manufacturing; Nd-Fe-B	SINTERED MAGNETS; NDFEB MAGNETS; RECOVERY; HYDROGEN; ROUTE	In this work, we describe an efficient and environmentally benign method of recycling of additive printed Nd-Fe-B polymer bonded magnets. Rapid pulverization of bonded magnets into composite powder containing Nd-Fe-B particles and polymer binder was achieved by milling at cryogenic temperatures. The recycled bonded magnets fabricated by warm compaction of ground cryomilled coarse composite powders and nylon particles showed improved magnetic properties and density. Remanent magnetization and saturation magnetization increased by 4% and 6.5% respectively, due to enhanced density while coercivity and energy product were retained from the original additive printed bonded magnets. This study presents a facile method that enables the direct reuse of end-of-life bonded magnets for remaking new bonded magnets. In addition to magnetic properties, mechanical properties comparable to commercial products have been achieved. This research advances efforts to ensure sustainability in critical materials by forming close loop supply chain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To achieve this goal, we demonstrate a nanogrid device by which solar energy can be stored in a modest sized battery system and use this to power instrumentation for melt extrusion of waste polymers into 3D printer filaments. We then use this filament in a modified 3D printer system to manufacture functional humanitarian aid components such as water seals and pipe connectors. We investigate the feasibility of the EcoPrinting principal using ABS and HDPE plastics, while evaluating and optimizing enabling device energy consumption and manufacturing performance. We conclude that the EcoPrinting principal is possible and functional devices can be manufactured with mechanical integrity equivalent to commercially available components. We finally demonstrate that EcoPrinting can be used as a tool for humanitarian use, realizing a manufacturing paradigm that is self-sufficient and potentially capable of addressing challenges of plastic proliferation in developing nations.

The reinforcement in recycled LDPE was made in different particulate sizes (mu m), namely, single particle size (SPS)/double particle size (DPS)/triple particle size (TPS) and in different weight proportions. The best combinations based upon wear and thermal stability were selected and used for filament wire preparation with twin-screw extruder (TSE). The cylindrical pins as RT reinforced with SiC/Al(2)O(3)were 3D printed on fused deposition modelling (FDM) setup for grinding applications. The outcome of the study highlights that SiC-TPS reinforcement in recycled LDPE matrix resulted in improved wear characteristics of RT prepared as MAM. Further thermographs based upon differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were plotted to ensure the thermal stability of RT prepared through MAM.

However, the application to glass powders, later subjected to viscous flow sintering, involves significant challenges, especially in shape retention and in the achievement of a substantial degree of translucency in the final products. The present paper disclosed the potential of glass recovered from liquid crystal displays (LCD) for the manufacturing of highly porous scaffolds by direct ink writing and masked stereolithography of fine powders mixed with suitable organic additives, and sintered at 950 degrees C, for 1-1.5 h, in air. The specific glass, featuring a relatively high transition temperature (T-g similar to 700 degrees C), allowed for the complete burn-out of organics before viscous flow sintering could take place; in addition, translucency was favored by the successful removal of porosity in the struts and by the resistance of the used glass to crystallization.

The versatility, reduction of equipment costs due to patents expiring and the great flexibility offered by 3D printers have driven the amazing increase of these technologies in the last years. On the other hand, the democratization of additive manufacturing also poses some issues regarding environment; it is important to also have into account the potential effects of these technologies in the environment, coming from energy consumption, materials, and wastes produced. A review of different research works dealing with environmental impact of additive manufacturing, such as products' life cycle assessment, energy and materials consumption, and particles and gases releases (mainly due to health issues), has been performed. The assessment performed has helped highlighting the importance of environmental issues in additive manufacturing, according to the number of published papers. The main findings are the importance of establishing a method for applying eco-design principles taking into account the specific features of additive manufacturing.

Plastic Bottle Cap Recycling-Characterization of Recyclate Composition and Opportunities for Design for Circularity	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						circular economy; design for circularity; EU policy; legacy additives; mechanical recycling; plastic bottle cap; polyethylene; polypropylene; single-use plastics directive; slip agent	PET BOTTLE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYOLEFIN FILMS; PRODUCT DESIGN; POLYETHYLENE; ADDITIVES; DEGRADATION; ERUCAMIDE; MIGRATION	In line with efforts to create a circular economy of plastics, recent EU legislation is strengthening plastic bottle recycling by ambitious separate collection targets and mandatory recycled content obligations. Furthermore, explicit design requirements on the caps of bottles and composite beverage packaging have been introduced. These caps are typically made of polyethylene or polypropylene and often contain additives such as slip agents and anti-statics. Commercially available bottle cap recyclates (BCRs) as well as specifically formulated model compounds were analyzed in terms of composition by means of infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Their composition was found to be heterogeneous due to polyolefin cross-contamination, directly reflecting the diversity of cap materials present in the market. Slip agent legacy additives originating from the initial use phase were found and quantified in both commercial and model cap recyclates. This highlights the opportunity for redesigning plastic bottle caps not only in response to regulatory requirements, but to pursue a more comprehensive strategy of product design for circularity. By including considerations of polymer resin and additive choice in cap manufacturing, more homogeneous waste streams could be derived from plastic bottle cap recycling, enabling recycling into more demanding and valuable applications.

Additive manufacturing and recycling by a laser-induced drop jet from a sheet edge	JOURNAL OF LASER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						additive manufacturing; melt drop ejection; laser-induced ablation; high speed imaging; metal recycling	MELT INJECTION; STEEL; DEPOSITION; IMPACT; STATE; EVOLUTION; EJECTION; STREAM	A new technique for additive manufacturing was recently presented by depositing droplets as a continuous track on a substrate, where the droplets were ejected from laser remote fusion cutting of a metal sheet. For the here presented approach, the droplets are instead ejected from the sheet edge, termed the machining mode, which is compared to cutting. Here, the transmitted part of the laser beam does not hit and interact with the deposited track because of lateral dislocation. High speed imaging has shown that laser-induced boiling, which drives the melt downwards, causes asymmetric conditions in the machining mode by lateral pushing of the generated drop jet under the sheet, where the melt can even attach. Compared to machining, the cutting mode keeps less deviation of the drop trajectories, higher precision, and a smoother surface finish. It was demonstrated that the edge conditions after machining are sufficient to repeat the process. This enables additional technique opportunities, including recycling of a whole sheet of waste metal. By the aid of high speed imaging from two different perspectives, the melt flow behavior, the drop jet precision, and process trends with respect to parameters, drop ejection, and deposition were studied.

J	Le, VT; Paris, H; Mandil, G				Van Thao Le; Paris, Henri; Mandil, Guillaume			Extracting features for manufacture of parts from existing components based on combining additive and subtractive technologies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING - IJIDEM			English	Article						Feature; Additive manufacturing; Machining; Process planning; Remanufacturing	C18400 COPPER ALLOY; OF-LIFE STRATEGIES; INTERFACIAL CHARACTERIZATION; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; SLM PARTS; DESIGN; SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK; ENTITIES; PHASE	The development of additive manufacturing (AM) technology provides the possibility of producing complex parts (including internal complex features) that are difficult to manufacture by machining. However, AM technologies also have some limitations, such as low-dimensional accuracy and long production times. Recently, combining additive manufacturing technology with CNC machining is gaining significant attention. This combination not only takes advantages of individual techniques, but also minimizes their disadvantages. In this paper, taking into account consolidated benefits of such technique combination, an alternative remanufacturing strategy is proposed. The strategy allows end-of-life parts (or existing parts) to be reused directly for manufacture of new parts (or final parts) without involving the material recycling stage. In addition, the final part is intended for another product, namely the existing part has a new life and new usage in its life cycle. To achieve the geometry and quality of final part, a sequence of additive, subtractive manufacturing and inspection operations will be generated. For this purpose, additive manufacturing features and machining features are first identified and extracted from the available information of the existing and final parts. This paper particularly focuses on a feature extraction approach, which is developed using the knowledge of additive manufacturing and CNC machining processes, technological requirements, and available resources. The major criteria and constraints have been defined and applied during the feature extraction process. The extracted features and their relationships will be used as the inputs for designing the process planning. Finally, a case study is used to illustrate the proposed approach.

The aim of the research was to characterize the IN 625 powder used over multiple manufacturing cycles with a Lasertec 30 SLM machine. In order to achieve the research's goal, virgin and recirculated powder's physical and technological characteristics were investigated. A decrease in all D-values (D-10, D-50, D-90) of the powder size distribution was observed after multiple recirculation cycles showing a decrease of the powder dimensional range over time. Both virgin and recirculated powders are composed of mainly spherical particles, but elongated particles and satellite particles were observed as well. The dimensional evolution analysis showed a deviation from the powder ideal roundness, deviation that is more pronounced over multiple recirculation cycles. It was experimentally determined that the powders present a good flowability based on the flow rate value obtained for both virgin and recirculated powders, confirmed also by the Hausner ratio and angle of repose.

Local and recyclable materials for additive manufacturing: 3D printing with mussel shells	MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Recycling; Local materials; Circular economy	CIRCULAR ECONOMY; SUSTAINABILITY; EVOLUTION	The potential of additive manufacturing (AM) for distributed production is often mentioned as an enabler for sustainable manufacturing within a circular economy. Currently, even if manufacturing with AM is distributed, the used materials can rarely be acquired locally and are usually obtained from a centralized location. Addressing this issue, we are developing an approach that supports the search for local materials that are suitable as material input for AM and are recyclable to serve multiple product lifecycles. The approach is an iterative process consisting of four phases; "material in AM context", "recycling opportunities", "material property testing", and "application possibilities". As an initial example, we present a process to adapt mussel shell waste into AM material. Mussel shells are a voluminous waste stream in the Netherlands. The shells, which mainly exist of calcium carbonate, are ground into a powder and combined with sugar water. Using a modified material extrusion process, 3D objects are created. In this paper, we discuss the iterations through our approach and illustrate the initial 3D printed results. With this project, we intend to demonstrate the potential of using local waste streams for AM processes for a circular economy. This is a first step towards the development of a methodology for linking local material streams to novel AM processes and meaningful applications.	[Sauerwein, M.; Doubrovski, E.

These filaments were extruded from recycled Nylon-6 granulates through a dedicated twin-screw extrusion line, which processes either pure Nylon-6 grains, or mixtures of such a material with minor fractions of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and titanium dioxide (TiO2). The rheological and thermal properties of the investigated filaments are analyzed, including melt flow index, melting temperature, and decomposition temperature, which are of the utmost importance when avoiding the overheating and decomposition of the material. Such a study is conducted in both pre-extrusion and post-extrusion conditions. The tensile strength, the wear resistance, and the printability of the examined recycled Nylon-6 filaments are also studied by comparing the properties of such filaments with those exhibited by different nylon-based filaments for FDM that are available in the market. The given results show that the recycling of Nylon-6 through the "caprolactam" regeneration route enables the newly formed material to retain high physical and mechanical properties, such as tensile strength at yield in the interval 55.79-86.91 MPa. Referring to the basic composition of the filaments examined in the present study, this remarkably high-yield strength is accompanied by a Young modulus of 1.64 GPa, and wear resistance of 92 mu m, under a 15 min/1 kg load pin-on-disk test carried at the sliding speed of 250 rpm.

The impact was studied in laboratory on the emitted fumes during the production process, on the properties used for mix design (compactability, water sensitivity, complex modulus at 15 degrees C/10 Hz, fatigue), on advanced thermomechanical behaviour (linear viscoelasticity, crack behaviour at low temperature, crack propagation) and on surface properties (skid resistance). The paper gathers many valuable results, showing the possibility to recycle bituminous mixtures multiple times, at high rates and with warm manufacturing process.

This technique allows producing complex parts that are not able to be manufactured by machining. However, AM techniques also present some limitations, such as poor surface quality, reduced dimensional accuracy, limited materials available and long production time when compared to CNC machining. To overcome these limitations, the combination of additive and subtractive (i.e. CNC machining) technologies is today considered as a promising solution for current manufacturing issues. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of combining these technologies for the manufacture of given parts from end-of-life (EoL) parts (or existing parts). The proposed approach aims to reuse existing parts directly to produce new parts (or final parts), avoiding the material recycling stage. The final parts are then intended for another product, namely the existing parts have a new life in their life cycle. This paper particularly focuses on the design of process planning for combined additive and subtractive processes, using the concept of AM and machining features. The design of process planning is performed based on the knowledge of additive and subtractive processes, the technological requirements, and the available resources. To respect constraints and considerations in manufacturing processes, different rules are defined and applied in the design of process planning. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through the case study. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

Today, knowledge regarding particle emissions and potential exposure-related health hazards for the operators is limited. The current study has focused on particle numbers, masses, sizes, and identities present in the air during additive manufacturing of metals. Measurements were performed during manufacturing with metal powder consisting essentially of chromium, nickel, and cobalt. Instruments used were Nanotracer (10 to 300 nanometers [nm]), Lighthouse (300 nm to 10 micrometers), and traditional filter-based particle mass estimation followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results showed that there is a risk of particle exposure at certain operations and that particle sizes tended to be smaller in recycled metal powder compared to new. In summary, nanosized particles were present in the additive manufacturing environment and the operators were exposed specifically while handling the metal powder. For the workers' safety, improved powder handling systems and measurement techniques for nanosized particles will possibly have to be developed and then translated into work environment regulations. Until then, relevant protective equipment and regular metal analyses of urine is recommended.

J	Le, V; Paris, H; Mandil, G				Van Thao Le; Paris, Henri; Mandil, Guillaume			The development of a strategy for direct part reuse using additive and subtractive manufacturing technologies	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Process planning; Feature; Remanufacturing; Life cycle	C18400 COPPER ALLOY; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; INTERFACIAL CHARACTERIZATION; SLM PARTS; DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; DEPOSITION; ENTITIES; FEATURES; PHASE	In recent years, combining additive and subtractive manufacturing technologies has attracted much attention from both industrial and academic sectors. Due to consolidated benefits of individual techniques, this combination provides new possibilities to manufacture products, and develop new strategies for recovering products at their end-of-life stage. This paper aims to develop a direct material reuse strategy based on such technique combination. The principle of the strategy is to manufacture new parts (or final parts) directly from end-of-life parts (or existing parts) without involving the material recycling phase. In this paper, a systematic methodology is proposed to develop the strategy. Firstly, the good mechanical characteristics of parts obtained by the strategy are confirmed. Thereafter, the design of process planning for combining additive and subtractive manufacturing processes is focused. This allows achieving the geometry and quality of final part from the existing part. The methodology for process planning design is developed in two major steps using the manufacturing feature concept, the knowledge of manufacturing processes, technological requirements, and available resources. In the first step, manufacturing features (i.e. machining and additive manufacturing features) are extracted from the information of the existing and final parts. In the second step, the process planning is generated from extracted features by respecting the relationships of features and the manufacturing precedence constraints. Finally, a case study is used to illustrate the proposed methodology.

Next, a recycling process of 3D printed carbon fiber reinforced nylon composite plain weft knitted structures is developed, to obtain recycled filament that can be directly used for 3D printing. The scanning electron microscope micrographs and the interfacial performance of the composite parts, manufactured from the original filament and the recycled one, were compared and analyzed. The results indicate that the performance of the recycled filament is continuously improving, because the recovery process enhances the infiltration of the nylon matrix into the surface of the carbon fiber. In the same printing condition, the tensile strength of composite printed with recycled filament is 56 MPa, which is improved by 16.7% compared to the composite printed using the original filament.

Support structures, which are necessary for overhanging surfaces during production, in most cases need to be manually removed and as such, they become waste material. In this paper, experimental approach is utilised in order to assess suitability of recycling support structures into recycled filament for FFF process. Mechanical properties of standardized specimens made from recycled polylactic acid (PLA) filament as well as influence of layer height and infill density on those properties were investigated. Optimal printing parameters for recycled PLA filaments are determined with Design of Experiment methods (DOE).

A new manufacturing method named "W3T4" was proposed to improve the performances of interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between recycled aggregate and mortar. The mechanical properties and the durability of RAC were tested, which show that this new manufacturing method improves the properties of RAC, and the GGBS with finest size makes a great contribution to the performance of RAC due to its better filling effect and much earlier pozzolanic reaction. Combined with GGBS, the effects of PHS on the retardation of setting time can be alleviated and the synergistic effect helps to make a more compact RAC. For the RAC with 25% of the recycled aggregate (RA) replacement and 10% PHS + 10% GGBS additives, the compressive strength increases by 25.4%, but the permeability decreases by 64.3% with respect to the reference concrete made with nature aggregates. The micro-mechanisms of these improvements were investigated by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM images show that the new manufacturing method, adding superfine pozzolanic powders and super-plasticizer benefits, makes a much denser ITZ in RAC.

This paper presents the possibility of using a natural zeolite to manufacture WMA as an alternative to existing synthetic products for the manufacture of this type of mixture. Moreover, the possibility of manufacturing WMA with the addition of recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) using natural zeolite as the basis of a warm mix technology was evaluated. Firstly, asphalt mixtures were manufactured at three different temperatures (145 degrees C, 135 degrees C, and 125 degrees C) with different percentages of natural zeolite to determine the temperature and the optimum content for the manufacture of WMA. Then, the zeolite moisture content and its release over time were determined at different temperatures, and its distribution in the binder was checked at different concentrations by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence. Next, with the optimum zeolite content, the addition of RAP between 10-30% in the WMA at the same three manufacturing temperatures was evaluated. Two types of compaction were used: the impact and gyratory compactions. The Marshall parameters were evaluated for all the designed mixtures. The results indicated that the manufacture of WMA with the addition of natural zeolite is feasible, and depending on the required mixing temperature, recycled WMA with different percentages of RAP can be obtained.

J	Kumar, S; Czekanski, A				Kumar, Sanjay; Czekanski, Aleksander			Roadmap to sustainable plastic additive manufacturing	MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Additive Manufacturing; Recycling; Selective Laser Sintering; Fused Deposition Modeling; Sustainable Production System	LASER SINTERING PROCESS; POWDERS	As additive manufacturing (AM) is heading towards mass production and mass customization, the process needs to be environment-friendly and energy-efficient in order to be self-sustainable. Selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) are two processes contributing massively towards plastic additive manufacturing. In SLS, the powders that do not contribute to the mass of products become unusable (after some number of reuse) and finally turn into waste. As high energy is required for production of powders, generation of these wastes impacts environment sustainability. A contrivance needs to be developed to convert these waste powders into high-value products to make the process sustainable. FDM has the largest market share in terms of number of AM systems sold and is the most popular for fabricating low-value products. Its usefulness will be further expanded if inexpensive high-value products could be made through this process. In the present work, waste SLS powder is employed to prepare feedstock for inexpensive high-value FDM products, which demonstrates that SLS refuse could be utilized for mass production of FDM feedstock. If two processes (SLS & FDM) will be connected as proposed here, it will make plastic additive manufacturing energy-efficient, self-sustainable, and will contribute to environment sustainability, in general.

J	Sears, PJ; Ho, K				Sears, Patrick J.; Ho, Koki			Impact Evaluation of In-Space Additive Manufacturing and Recycling Technologies for On-Orbit Servicing	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	AIAA Space Forum and Exposition	SEP 12-14, 2017	Orlando, FL	AIAA				This paper proposes an integrated simulation tool to evaluate the impact of future in-space additive manufacturing (ISAM) and recycling technologies on the responsiveness of an on-orbit servicing (OOS) infrastructure to random failures of satellites distributed over an orbit. The considered OOS infrastructure is composed of a mothership and a servicer (i.e., daughtership); the mothership serves as a depot for spares, whereas the servicer travels with the spares to randomly failed satellites and provides a service. All satellites are assumed to be modularized, and thus, the service type considered within the infrastructure is the replacement of a failed module with a new spare one. Additionally, an ISAM facility can be added to the mothership, which can scavenge material that makes up the failed module. This obtained feedstock from failed modules, along with raw material supplied from Earth, could be used to manufacture a new spare. The key parameters in this analysis include the technology level of ISAM, in terms of the types of material it can manufacture, and the scavenge rate, defined as the percent of material mass able to be recycled from the failed module to the new module. The two metrics for evaluation are the required resupply launch mass to the mothership and the average waiting time of the satellites before it is serviced. Simulation results showed that the ISAM and recycling technology provides a large impact in terms of both reduction in resupply launch mass and responsiveness of its service to the randomly failed satellites.

PET is currently used in many applications, including the manufacture of bottles and tableware. Monomer extraction from waste PET is expensive, and this process has not yet been successfully demonstrated on a viable scale. Hence, any method to recycle or regenerate PET once it has been used is of significant importance from scientific and environmental research viewpoints. Such a process would be a green alternative due to reduced raw monomer consumption and the additional benefit of reduced manufacturing costs. The membranes described here were prepared by a phase-inversion process, which involved casting a solution containing PET, m-cresol as solvent, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights as additives. The membranes were characterized in terms of pure water permeability (PWP), molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), and flux and membrane morphology. The results show that the addition of PEG with high molecular weights leads to membranes with higher PWP. The presence of additives affects surface roughness and membrane morphology.

Processing the powder residue into filaments for extrusion-based additive manufacturing (EAM) provides an opportunity to recycle SLS residue without significantly reducing its value. In this study, the feasibility of using a milled carbon fiber (mCF)/recycled polyamide12 (rPA12) composite filament for EAM was demonstrated. A microscopic study on the morphology of mCF showed that mCF is a short and smooth fiber. The mCF did not significantly change the melting temperature, crystallization temperature or crystallinity of rPA12 as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A morphological study on the fracture-surface of the composites revealed that there was moderate interfacial interaction between the mCF and PA12. Tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength of rPA12 were improved by 35%, 163%, 61%, 138% and 23%, respectively with the addition of 30 wt.% mCF.

A decision-support model for selecting additive manufacturing versus subtractive manufacturing based on energy consumption	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Material efficiency; Additive manufacturing; Subtractive manufacturing; Energy consumption		This paper presents a simple computational model for determining whether additive manufacturing or subtractive manufacturing is more energy efficient for production of a given metallic part. The key discriminating variable is the fraction of the bounding envelope that contains material - i.e. the volume fraction of solid material. For both the additive process and the subtractive process the total energy associated with the production of a part is defined in terms of the volume fraction of that part. The critical volume fraction is that for which the energy consumed by subtractive manufacturing equals the energy consumed by additive manufacturing. For volume fractions less than the critical value, additive manufacturing is more energy efficient. For volume fractions greater than the critical value, subtractive manufacturing is more efficient. The model considers the entire manufacturing lifecycle - from production and transport of feedstock material through processing to return of post-production scrap for recycling. Energy consumed by processing equipment while idle is also accounted for in the model. Although the individual energy components in the model are identified and accounted for in the expressions for additive and subtractive manufacturing, values for many of these components may not be currently available. Energy values for some materials' production and subtractive and additive manufacturing processes can be found in the literature. However, since many of these data are reported for a very specific application, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to reliably apply this data to new process-material manufacturing scenarios since, very often, insufficient information is provided to enable extrapolation to broader use. Consequently, this paper also highlights the need to develop improved knowledge of the energy embodied in each phase of the manufacturing process. To be most valuable, users of the model should determine the energy consumed by their manufacturing process equipment on the basis of energy-per unit-volume of production for each material of interest considering both alloy composition and form. Energy consumed during machine idle per unit time should also be determined by the user then scaled to specific processing scenarios. Energy required to generate feedstock material (billet, plate, bar, wire, powder) must be obtained from suppliers.

Polymer recycling codes for distributed manufacturing with 3-D printers	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						3-D printing; Additive manufacturing; Recycling codes; Polymers; Distributed manufacturing	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; WASTE MANAGEMENT; ASSESSMENT LCA; FEEDSTOCK; PLASTICS; REPRAP; SYSTEM; DEBRIS; IMPACT	With the aggressive cost reductions for 3-D printing made available by the open-source self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) the economic advantage of custom distributed manufacturing has become substantial. In addition, the number of free designs is growing exponentially and the development and commercialization of the recyclebot (plastic extruders that fabricate 3-D printing filament from recycled or virgin materials) have greatly improved the material selection available for prosumer 3-D printer operators. These trends indicate that more individuals will manufacturer their own polymer products, however, there is a risk that an even larger fraction of polymer waste will not be recycled because it has not been coded. The current limited resin identification code available in the U.S. similarly restricts closing the loop on less popular polymers, which could hamper the environmental impact benefits of distributed manufacturing. This paper provides a solution for this challenge by (1) developing a recycling code model based off of the resin identification codes developed in China that is capable of expansion as more complex 3-D printing materials are introduced, (2) creating OpenSCAD scripts based on (1) to be used to print resin identification codes into products, (3) demonstrating the use of this functionality in a selection of products and polymer materials, and (4) outlining the software and policy tools necessary to make this application possible for widespread adoption. Overall the results showed that a far larger resin code identification system can be adopted in the U.S. to expand distributed recycling of polymers and manufacturing of plastic-based 3-D printed products.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A 3D PRINTER WITH RECYCLING SYSTEM	2011 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXPOSITION	ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition	JUN 26-29, 2011	Vancouver, CANADA	ASEE				This paper presents the design and development of the Cupcake 3D CNC printer, a special class of machines designed for the automated construction of physical objects using additive layer manufacturing technology. The printer system is great for fabricating parts and designs that are not available on the open market. It prints with Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Polylactic Acid (PLA) plastics. To print a design, the printer platform moves in the X-Y plane and the extruder along the Z-axis with precision stepper motors while the extruder continually places a small stream of melted ABS. The recycler's addition to the printing system provides a way to reduce cost and make the system more environmentally friendly. A rotating auger bit inside an enclosure barrel forces the particulate down the tube. An electric motor turns the auger which grabs the material to move it down the barrel. Prototype of this design and the 3D printer were fabricated and tested to determine proper functionality. The 3D printer and the recycling system are currently being used to: teach additive layer manufacturing and rapid prototyping to students enrolled in manufacturing courses; print prototypes for new, difficult to find or expensive parts for research/design projects; and recycle the scrap ABS from the Cupcake 3D printer to a 3 mm filament and reuse it for printing new parts and prototypes. Samples printed using the 3D printer, the advantages of the recycling system, the difficulties encountered during the design and development, and recommendations for future recycling system design are presented and discussed.

Closed-loop recycling of plastics enabled by dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds	NATURE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RECYCLABLE POLYESTER; POLY(ETHYLENE-TEREPHTHALATE); THERMOSETS; STABILITY; POLYMERS; FUTURE	Recycled plastics are low-value commodities due to residual impurities and the degradation of polymer properties with each cycle of re-use. Plastics that undergo reversible polymerization allow high-value monomers to be recovered and re-manufactured into pristine materials, which should incentivize recycling in closed-loop life cycles. However, monomer recovery is often costly, incompatible with complex mixtures and energy-intensive. Here, we show that next-generation plastics-polymerized using dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds-allow the recovery of monomers from common additives, even in mixed waste streams. Poly(diketoenamine)s 'click' together from a wide variety of triketones and aromatic or aliphatic amines, yielding only water as a by-product. Recovered monomers can be re-manufactured into the same polymer formulation, without loss of performance, as well as other polymer formulations with differentiated properties. The ease with which poly(diketoenamine) s can be manufactured, used, recycled and re-used-without losing value-points to new directions in designing sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.

In this regard, asphalt mix industries are also making their contribution to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzene during the manufacturing and laying processes of bituminous mixes, as well as reducing waste generation when eliminating aged pavements or manufacturing surplus. In order to achieve this objective, mixes that can be produced and compacted at lower temperatures are becoming increasingly popular to bring about a reduction in gas emissions and obtain improvements in working conditions for employees in contact with them, without losing the mechanical characteristics of the conventional asphalt mixes (manufactured and compacted at 160 degrees C and 130 degrees C, respectively). This article summarizes the main techniques currently existing in the manufacture and placement of bituminous mixtures at lower temperatures, as well as the techniques applicable in the reuse of aged pavement, and introduces the use of some methods to assess the choice between different types of mixes, such as analysis of the life cycle and its economic variants.

We propose a process for handling and additively manufacturing powders that functions independently of the gravitational environment and with no restriction on feedstock powder flowability. Based on a specific sequence of boundary loads applied to the granular packing, powder is transported to the printing zone, homogenized and put under compression to increase the density of the final part. The powder deposition process is validated by simulations that show the homogeneity and density of deposition to be insensitive to gravity and cohesion forces within a discrete element method (DEM) model. We further provide an experimental proof of concept of the process by successfully 3D printing parts on-ground and on parabolic flight in weightlessness. Powders exhibiting high and low flowability are used as model feedstock material to demonstrate the versatility of the process, opening the way for additive manufacturing of recycled material.

The focus is also on the effect of multiple closed-loop recycling of ABS. Design/methodology/approach A conventional direct-drive, Cartesian-type machine and a Bowden, Delta-type machine with an infrared radiant heating system are used to manufacture test specimens molded in ABS. Afterward, multiple closed-loop recycling cycles are conducted, involving consecutive AM (four times) and recycling (three times). The rheological, mechanical, morphological and physicochemical properties are investigated. Findings The type of machine affects the quality of the produced parts. The machine containing an infrared radiant system in a temperature-controlled chamber produces parts showing higher mechanical properties and filling fraction, although it increases the yellowing. Closed-loop recycling of ABS for AM is applicable for at least two cycles, inducing a slight increase in tensile modulus (ca. 5%) and in tensile strength (ca. 13%) and a decrease in the impact strength (ca. 14%) and melt viscosity. An increase in the filling fraction of the AM parts promotes an increase in tensile strength and tensile modulus, although it does not influence the impact strength. Furthermore, multiple closed-loop recycling does not affect the overall chemical structure of ABS. Practical implications Controlling the environmental temperature and using infrared radiant heating during AM of ABS improves the quality of the produced parts. Closed-loop recycling of ABS used in AM is feasible up to at least two recycling steps, supporting the implementation of a circular economy for polymer-based AM. Originality/value This study shows original results regarding the assessment of the effect of different types of AM machines on the main end-use properties of ABS parts and the influence of multiple closed-loop recycling on the characteristics of ABS fabricated by the most suited AM machine with an infrared radiant heating system and a temperature-controlled environment.

Performance of Warm-Mix Asphalt Mixtures Containing Recycled Coal Ash and Roofing Shingles with Moist Aggregates for Low-Volume Roads	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							SUSCEPTIBILITY; ADDITIVES	The objective of this study was to evaluate the laboratory moisture and rutting susceptibility of low-volume hot-mix asphalt (HMA) and warm-mix asphalt (WMA) mixtures containing moist aggregates and recycled materials such as manufactured roofing shingles and coal ash. The test properties of these mixtures included indirect tensile strength, tensile strength ratio, flow value, and rut depth of dry and wet specimens. The experimental design included two percentages of coal ash (10% and 5% by weight of the aggregate), two shingle contents (5% and 3% by weight of the aggregate), three WMA additives (Aspha-Min, Sasobit, and Evotherm), and two aggregate sources. Thirty-two mix designs were performed, and 256 specimens were tested. Test results indicated that the aggregate source significantly affected moisture and rutting resistance regardless of WMA additive or recycled material type. In addition, dry and wet rut depth values of low-volume mixtures containing moist aggregate generally satisfied the demand of pavement performance without requiring additional treatment. Moreover, the addition of WMA additives in low-volume mixtures was effective and generally showed a similar rut resistance to HMA. The utilization of recycled coal ash and roofing shingles significantly improved moisture and rutting resistance of HMA and WMA mixtures.

Effect of recycled powder content on the structure and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V alloy produced by direct energy deposition	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Direct energy deposition; Powder reuse; Ti-6Al-4V alloy; Mechanical tests	OXYGEN; MICROSTRUCTURE; TITANIUM; REUSE	Direct energy deposition (DED) is a promising additive manufacturing technique in the area of aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding and medical industries. DED allows producing large-scale parts that imply the use of a significant amount of powders. Powder reuse is an important task that leads to a reduction in the cost of the final products. In this work, Ti-6Al-4V samples were fabricated by DED technique with a mixture of unused and recycled powders in the recycled powder content of 0%, 10%, 25%, and 50%. The results show that the morphology of the powder does not change significantly due to a low number of powder uses. Chemical analysis reveals a slight decrease of V in the recycled powder. The evolution of macrostructure with increasing recycled powder content was not revealed. In the as-built samples, the columnar prior beta grains grow toward the build direction with a typical Widmanstatten structure consisting of the thin alpha' laths. The mix of Widmanstatten microstructure and basket weave microstructure appears after the annealing at 800 celcius. Furthermore, the horizontal and vertical annealed samples exhibit ductile fracture and inconspicuous anisotropy of tensile and impact mechanical properties. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, the focus is on pore formation in recycled powder particles of stainless steel 316L during the selective laser melting process. We have introduced the concept of optimizing the powder bed's printing area in order to see the extent of the affected powders during the 3D-printing process. X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) is used to characterize the pores inside the particles. The results from image processing of the tomography (rendered in 3D format) indicate a broader pore size distribution and a higher pore density in recycled powders compared to their virgin counterparts. To elucidate on this, the Electron Dispersion spectroscopy (EDX) analysis and Synchrotron-based Hard X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (HAXPES) were performed to reveal the chemical composition distribution across the pore area and bulk of the recycled powder particles. Higher concentrations of Fe, Cr, and Ni were recorded on the interior wall of the pore in recycled particles and higher Mn, S and Si concentrations were recorded in the outer layer around the pore area and on the surface of the recycled particle. The pore formation in recycled powder is attributed to out-diffusion of Mn, S and Si to the outer surface as a result of the incident laser heat during the AM process due to higher electron affinity of such metallic elements to oxygenation. HAXPES analysis shows a higher MnO concentration around the pore area which impedes the in-diffusion of other elements into the bulk and thereby helps to creates a void. The inside wall of the pore area (dendrites), has a higher concentration of Fe and Cr oxide. We believe the higher pore density in recycled powders is due, at least in part to composition redistribution, promoted by laser heat during the AM process. Nanoindentation analyses on both virgin and recycled powder particles shows a lower hardness and higher effective modulus in the recycled powder particles attributed to the higher porosity in recycled powders.

In order to achieve this goal, obtaining a homogeneous microstructure and eliminating material defects within the fabricated parts are important research issues. The objective of this experimental study is to evaluate the effect of thermal post-processing of AlSi10Mg parts, using recycled powder, with the aim of improving the microstructure homogeneity of the as-built parts. This work is essential for the cost-effective additive manufacturing (AM) of metal optics and optomechanical systems. To achieve this goal, a full characterization of fresh and recycled powder was performed, in addition to a microstructure assessment of the as-built fabricated samples. Annealing, solution heat treatment (SHT) and T6 heat treatment (T6 HT) were applied under different processing conditions. The results demonstrated an improvement in microstructure homogeneity after thermal post-processing under specific conditions of SHT and T6 HT. A micro-hardness map was developed to assist in the selection of the optimized post-processing parameters in order to satisfy the design requirements of the part.

A new wet-end chemical program provides improved production rates and runnability without changing the incoming fiber mix. The system uses a high molecular weight cationic dispersion or emulsion polymer with a modified natural polymer. The new system does not require any change in operating conditions or involve any mechanical modifications to the paper machine.

Additive manufacturing for circular product design: a literature review from a design perspective	PRODUCT LIFETIMES AND THE ENVIRONMENT (PLATE)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd Conference on Product Lifetimes and the Environment (PLATE)	NOV 08-10, 2017	Delft Univ Technol, Fac Ind Design Engn, Delft, NETHERLANDS		Delft Univ Technol, Fac Ind Design Engn	Circular product design; Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Circular economy; Sustainability	SUSTAINABILITY; CHALLENGES; EVOLUTION; ECONOMY; IMPACTS	Circular product design is a relatively new approach to design suitable strategies to realize circular products. Additive manufacturing (AM) is seen as a promising enabling production process. It has digital and additive characteristics, which makes AM different from conventional production techniques. However, it is yet unclear how this technique can contribute to circular product design in practice. In this paper, a literature review is placed in context, i.e. the results of a literature review on sustainability opportunities in AM are compared to five typical design cases in a design review. The outcomes of the literature study reveal the aspects of the digital and additive characteristics of AM, that lead to potential sustainability opportunities. We compared these aspects to the circular design strategies as described by Bakker et al. (2014) and Bocken et al. (2016) in the context of the five selected design projects. Each project is described in terms of circular design strategies and how these were achieved through additive manufacturing. Using design practice to reflect on the outcomes of the literature review resulted in a better understanding of the potential of additive manufacturing for circular product design. The relation between the sustainability aspects of AM and the circular design strategies were made explicit. AM seems to be especially suitable to customize parts to fit existing products and to contribute to new opportunities regarding material recycling. These findings deserve further exploration in order to understand the motives for implementation in circular product design.	[Sauerwein, M.; Bakker, C. A.; Balkenende, A.

Taking into account performance of these techniques in a 'new remanufacturing strategy' can open new ways to transform an end-of-life (EoL) part into a new part intended for another product. The strategy might allow a considerable material proportion of existing parts to be reused directly for producing new parts without passing through the recycling stage. In this work, the strategy enable the transformation of existing parts into desired parts is first presented. The strategy uses an adequate sequence of additive and subtractive operations, as well as inspection operations to achieve the geometry and quality of final parts. This sequence will be designed from a set of AM features and machining features, which are extracted from available technical information and the CAD models of existing part, and final part. The core of the paper focuses on the feature extraction approach. The approach development is based on the knowledge of AM processes and machining process, as well as the specifications of final part.

Under the traffic action, always more constraint and the climatic blitzes, the pavements crumbling occurs rapidly, which leads to severe impairments that are reflected on the surface layers: rutting, cracking, substances rejection, polishing and pulling out the aggregates on surface. This situation often involves the renovation of the surface's layers. It is, therefore urgent to appeal to a new vision of pavement design based on optimizing the use of local materials, non-renewable, and respect for the environment. The recycling of bituminous substances are one of the relevant solutions. It has the advantage of reusing building materials by mixing them with a proportion of refined ones to achieve the required performance. This assignment researches for different rates of coated aggregates, the effects of manufacturing temperature and blending time in the mixing of the constituents during production as well as the additive plastomers of polyolefins on the improvement of the recycled asphalt rutting. Rutting is one of the most encountered degradation phenomena in the Algerian roads. The formulated hypothesis used here assumes that the elastomer polyolefins additive have an influence on the mechanical performance (rutting) of the recycled asphalt and also on the rate of the used asphalt aggregates. To justify this hypothesis it is mandatory to go through the manufacture of the asphalt with different rate of asphalt aggregates. To reduce the number of experimental tests necessary for this study, we used the experimental approaches method.

Non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) in recycled plastics	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Mechanical-recycling; Plastics; Domestic-waste; Polyolefins; NIAS; IAS	HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; ODORANT COMPOSITION; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; CONTAMINATION; WASTE; EFFICIENCY; QUALITY; MOLDS	The demand for high quality recycled polymers in the European plastic industry is on the increase, likely due to the EU's Plastic Strategy intended to implement the circular economy model in this sector. The problem is that there is not enough recycled plastic in the market. In terms of volume, post-consumer plastic waste could be key to meet the current and future demand. Nevertheless, a high level of contamination originated during the product's life cycle restricts its use. The first step to change this must be identifying the undesired substances in post-consumer plastics and performing an effective risk assessment. The acquired knowledge will be fundamental for the development of innovative decontamination technologies. In this study, 134 substances including volatile and semi-volatile compounds have been identified in recycled LDPE and HDPE from domestic waste. Headspace and solvent extraction followed by GC/MS were used. The possible origin of each substance was studied. The main groups were additives, polymer and additives breakdown products, and contamination from external sources. The results suggest that recycled LDPE contains a broader number of additives and their degradation products. Some of them may cause safety concerns if reused in higher added value applications. Regarding recycled HDPE, the contaminants from the use phase are predominant creating problems such as intense odors. To reduce the number of undesired substances, it is proposed to narrow the variety of additives used in plastic manufacturing and to opt for separate waste collection systems to prevent cross-contamination with organic waste.

Prior studies on environmental impact assessment of metal AM have underestimated the resource consumption due to the overestimation of the material utilization factor and neglecting the energy consumption needed to produce the desirable feedstock powder. This paper aims to address the role of feedstock powder and the actual material utilization factor in environmental impact assessment of laser metal deposition. Recycling and reuse of the unfused powder as the feedstock for subsequent depositions are proposed. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Polymeric material extrusion processes have been broadly addressed with a specific definition of all parameters and variables for all different of technologies approaches and materials. Recycled polymeric materials have been studied due to the growing importance of the environmental awareness of the contemporary society. Beside this, little specific research has been found in product development applications for AM where the printed parts are in highly moisture environments or surrounded by water, but polymers have been for long used in such industries with conventional manufacturing approaches. This work focuses on the analysis and comparison of two different additively manufactured polymers printed by fused filament fabrication (FFF) processes using desktop-size printers to be applied for product design. The polymers used have been a recycled material: polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) and polylactic acid (PLA). Degradation and water absorption behaviors of both materials are presented, analyzed and discussed in this paper, where different samples have been immersed in saturated solutions of water with maritime salt and sugar together with a control sample immersed in distilled water. The samples have been dimensionally and weight-controlled weekly as well as microscopically analyzed to understand degradation and absorption processes that appear in the fully saturated solutions. The results revealed how the absorption process is stabilized after a reduced number of weeks for both materials and how the degradation process is more remarked in the PLA material due to its organic nature.

This method provides a design-for-remanufacturing approach, which offer solutions for product upgrade or repair. To be specific, a used part is first machined to remove material, and then additively deposited of materials on top. In this way, either the function of the part is upgraded or the broken part is repaired. Beneficially, the used part is economically and environment-friendly recycled. This method is developed under the level set framework and innovatively, the layer-wise level set representation of the additive manufacturing part is adopted for self-support and material anisotropy control. Especially for the latter point, the hybrid deposition path, a combination of contour-offset and zig-zag path patterns, is adopted for deposition path planning, which will be concurrently optimized for the best material anisotropy distribution. Therefore, what will be presented in this paper is a novel combination of structural topological design and process planning to derive the optimal hybrid remanufacturing strategy. This is a very novel trial and we have performed experiments to verify its effectiveness.

Nevertheless, the increasing demand for PVC and current ineffective disposal methods have made it a potentially severe environmental hazard. The chemical recycling of PVC through hydrolytic or aminolytic routes has shown significant promise, however, their end applications have been limited as of now. This study is concerned with the chemical modification of PVC by amines into additives, and its ensuing use as a performance enhancing modifier for bitumen. In view of this, additives were firstly synthesised by the amination of PVC with two kinds of polyamines; triethylenetetramine (TETA) and ethylene diamine (ED) respectively. These were then chemically characterised by solid state Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) and elemental analysis. Subsequently, the aminated PVC additives were blended with virgin asphalt binder and its effectiveness was evaluated in terms of moisture susceptibility and rheological properties. The results of the preliminary laboratory studies indicated that the binders modified with the additives showed significantly improved anti-stripping properties and overall rheological performance as compared to conventional binder. Overall, the usage of such waste PVC based additives as modifier for bituminous mixtures represents an innovative approach to deal with a relevant recycling problem while simultaneously recovering a value-added material.

The refining of secondary lead for use in advanced lead-acid batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Secondary; Lead; Refining; Advanced; Acid; Batteries		Secondary lead, i.e. material produced by the recycling of lead-acid batteries has become the primary source of lead in much of the world. This has been important to the secondary lead industry as other uses have dwindled, e.g. lead based pigments, chemicals, fuel additives, solders and CRT glasses [1]. Presently, battery manufacturing accounts for greater than 80% of lead consumption while recycled lead accounts for approximately the same market share of lead supply. These two facts strongly demonstrate the battery manufacturing and recycled lead are intimately coupled in everyday life. In this paper we will explore how recycled lead has become the material of choice for battery construction through the development of a recovery and refining process that exceeds the industries requirements. Particular focus will be on addressing the results presented by Prengaman [2] on the effects of contaminant or tramp elements on gassing in lead-acid batteries. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This process also allows direct recycling of plastic into new parts, which eases the raw material supply. However, although several methodologies are used to redesign products and parts, none is dedicated to a real design of parts and products in AM. At first, we will suggest the base of a new design methodology for an end-user who wants to create a product or a part in AM. Then, we will show an example of using our methodology. Finally, we will conclude on the limits of this methodology and on our next work to validate our methodology.

Open Source Vacuum Oven Design for Low-Temperature Drying: Performance Evaluation for Recycled PET and Biomass	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING AND MATERIALS PROCESSING			English	Article						drying; materials processing; vacuum oven; small-scale; lab equipment; air-powered; open hardware; open source; digital manufacturing; dehydration		Vacuum drying can dehydrate materials further than dry heat methods, while protecting sensitive materials from thermal degradation. Many industries have shifted to vacuum drying as cost- or time-saving measures. Small-scale vacuum drying, however, has been limited by the high costs of specialty scientific tools. To make vacuum drying more accessible, this study provides design and performance information for a small-scale open source vacuum oven, which can be fabricated from off-the-shelf and 3-D printed components. The oven is tested for drying speed and effectiveness on both waste plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and a consortium of bacteria developed for bioprocessing of terephthalate wastes to assist in distributed recycling of PET for both additive manufacturing as well as potential food. Both materials can be damaged when exposed to high temperatures, making vacuum drying a desirable solution. The results showed that the open source vacuum oven was effective at drying both plastic and biomaterials, drying at a higher rate than a hot-air dryer for small samples or for low volumes of water. The system can be constructed for less than 20% of commercial vacuum dryer costs for several laboratory-scale applications, including dehydration of bio-organisms, drying plastic for distributed recycling and additive manufacturing, and chemical processing.

J	Laoutid, F; Lafqir, S; Toncheva, A; Dubois, P				Laoutid, Fouad; Lafqir, Soumaya; Toncheva, Antoniya; Dubois, Philippe			Valorization of Recycled Tire Rubber for 3D Printing of ABS- and TPO-Based Composites	MATERIALS			English	Article						tire rubber recycling; polymer composites; additive manufacturing; fused deposition modeling	GROUND TYRE RUBBER; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; WASTE; DEGRADATION; NANOSILICA; CONCRETE; BLENDS	Vulcanized and devulcanized ground tire rubber microparticles have been used as a minor phase in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer (ABS) and thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO) for the development of materials with desired functionalities by 3D printing. These polymers have been selected because they (i) present part of the plastic waste generated by the automotive industry and (ii) have totally different properties (ABS for its stiffness and robustness and TPO for its softness and ductility). The study aims to improve the circular economy of the automotive industry by proposing a promising route for recycling the generated tire rubber waste. In this respect, emergent technology for plastic processing such as 3D printing is used, as part of the additive manufacturing technologies for the prolongated end of life of recycled plastics originated from automotive waste such as ABS and TPO. The obtained results revealed that (i) the composites are suitable for successful filament production with desired composition and diameter required for successful 3D printing by fused deposition modeling, and that (ii) the optimization of the composition of the blends allows the production of materials with interesting mechanical performances. Indeed, some of the investigated ABS-recycled rubber tire blends exhibit high impact properties as TPO-based composites do, which in addition exhibits elongation at break higher than 500% and good compression properties, accompanied with good shape recovery ratio after compression.

Pin Fin Array Heat Sinks by Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing: Economics of Powder Recycling	INTERNATIONAL THERMAL SPRAY CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION (ITSC 2018)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Thermal Spray Conference and Exposition (ITSC)	MAY 07-10, 2018	Orlando, FL	ASM Int, Thermal Spray Soc, ASM Int, German Welding Soc, IIW			GAS-DYNAMIC SPRAY	As a result of the rise in processing power demands of today's personal computers, water cooled pin fin heat sinks are increasingly being employed for the cooling of graphical processing units. Currently, these high performance devices are manufactured through high-cost, high-waste processes. In recent years, a new solution has emerged using the cold gas dynamic spray process, in which pin fins are directly manufactured onto a base plate by spraying metallic powder particles through a mask. This process allows for a high degree of adaptability to different graphics processing unit shapes and sizes not achievable by any other process to date. One drawback of this new additive manufacturing process is reduced deposition efficiency, resulting in a fair portion of the feedstock powder being wasted as substrate sensitivity to heat and mechanical residual stresses requires the use of reduced spray parameters. This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using powder recycling to mitigate this issue and compares coatings sprayed with reclaimed powder to their counterparts sprayed with as-received powder. In so doing, cold gas dynamic spray is shown to be a highly flexible and economically competitive process for the production of pin fin heat sinks even when spray parameters result in reduced deposition efficiency.

The technique involves an ultrasonically agitated cold crucible installed at the top of a 20 kHz ultrasonic sonotrode. The material is melted with an electric arc and undergoes pulverization with standing wave vibrations. Several different alloys in various forms, including noble and metallic glass alloys, were chosen to test the process. The atomized particles showed exceptional sphericity, while powder output suitable for additive manufacturing reached up to 60%. The AMZ4 metallic glass powder remained amorphous below the 50 mu m fraction, while tungsten addition led to crystallization in each fraction. Minor contamination and high Mn and Zn evaporation, especially in the finest particles, was observed in atomized powders. The innovative ultrasonic atomization method appears as a promising tool for material scientists to develop powders with tailored chemical composition, size and structure.

The droplets are generated by laser remote fusion cutting of a supply sheet that could be a waste material, for recycling purposes. The laser-induced ablation pressure at the cutting front continuously drives melt downwards below the supply sheet in the form of a liquid column. Droplets separate from the column and solidify as a track on a substrate below. The droplets, surrounded by vapour, had in this case an average diameter of 500 mu m and a speed of 2 m/s, with deviations up to 50%. Sound clad tracks were generated on steel and aluminium substrates. In the case of a copper substrate discontinuous clad tracks were produced as a result of poor wetting. The droplet jet had a small divergence of about 5 degrees, which is suitable for controlled deposition. The transmitted part of the laser beam interacted with the clad track but did not affect the process result. High speed imaging was found to be a suitable tool for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the technique. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Samarjy, Ramiz S. M.; Kaplan, Alexander F.

Magnetic properties and thermal stability of both the waste magnets and recycled magnets were investigated. The recycled magnet exhibits magnetic properties with remanence (B-r) of 12.38 kGs, coercivity (H-ci) of 24.89 kOe, and maximum energy product [(BH)(max)] of 36.51 MGOe, respectively, which restores 99.20% of B-r, 105.65% of H-ci, and 98.65% of (BH)(max) of the waste magnets, respectively. The volume fraction of Nd-rich phase in the recycled magnets is about 10.1 vol.%, which is bigger than that of the waste magnets due to the additive of Nd3PrFe14B alloy containing more rare earth. The remanence temperature coefficient (alpha) and coercivity temperature coefficient (beta) of the recycled magnets are -0.1155%/K and -0.5099%/K in the range of 288-423 K, respectively, which are comparative to those of the waste magnets.

In first stage, recycled low density polyethylene (LDPE) has been selected as matrix material, while ceramic reinforcement of SiC and Al2O3 has been blended in LDPE by screw extrusion. Initially, the recycled LDPE has been collected in granules form from the local market and processed on single screw extruder to prepare pallets. The ceramic particles and LDPE were blended together to prepared the final blend in different proportions on twin screw extruder. After that Taguchi L9 orthogonal array has been employed to ascertain the affect of different input parameters of FDM machine to prepare the functional prototypes in the form of cubical patterns. Instead of using conventional IC, a rapid method has been employed to prepare sacrificial pattern by using siladent powder (which is being used for preparing cast in clinical dentistry for dentures). Further this method has been explored as an alternate route of rapid IC, which requires very less time as compared to the traditional methods.

Especially machining offers great potential for the conservation of energy, resources and the reuse of raw materials. This article gives an overview on the approaches that are currently under investigation at the Institute of Production Engineering and Machine Tools with the aim of improving these aspects. The approaches cover regrinding methods for worn tools, recycling of titanium chips and process planning for hybrid process chains. In the first part of the article, a novel process chain for the automatic regrinding of cemented carbide tools is presented. It is shown that production costs can be reduced significantly, as well as the required energy for production of carbide tools. In the second part of the article, approaches for the recycling of titanium chips from machining processes are described. The last part focuses on the resource and energy efficiency of process chains that contain additive and subtractive processes. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Leng, Z; Padhan, RK; Sreeram, A				Leng, Zhen; Padhan, Rabindra Kumar; Sreeram, Anand			Production of a sustainable paving material through chemical recycling of waste PET into crumb rubber modified asphalt	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Waste PET; Crumb rubber; Recycling; Modified asphalt; Sustainable paving	PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITES; BITUMEN	Plastic materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are extensively used in manufacturing drinking bottles, food packaging and many other forms of plastic products. However, the inappropriate disposal of large amount of PET waste may cause severe environmental problems. Using PET derived products as a performance-enhancing additive for asphalt can be one of the alternatives to recycle and reuse this waste material. Similarly, disposal of waste vehicle tyres is also a challenging environmental problem. Research has shown that the use of crumb rubber (CR) from waste tyres in asphalt helps improve some of its rheological properties but is often plagued with other concerns such as low storage stability. The main objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using the waste PET additives, derived through an aminolysis process, to improve the storage stability and rheological performance of crumb rubber modified asphalt (CRMA). Both the storage stability, and rheological and chemical properties of the asphalt binders collectively modified with PET additives and CR were investigated. It was found that the incorporation of PET based additives to CRMA improved the storage stability, rutting and fatigue resistances, and increased the rotational viscosity (RV) of the modified binders. Overall, the results indicated that the collective usage of waste PET derived additives and scrap tyre rubber in asphalt not only helps recycle waste plastic and rubber, but also improves the engineering properties of asphalt pavement.

A literature survey on structural integrity of 3D printed virgin and recycled ABS and PP compounds	1ST VIRTUAL EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FRACTURE - VECF1	Procedia Structural Integrity		English	Proceedings Paper	1st European-Structural-Integrity-Society (ESIS) Virtual European Conference on Fracture (ECF)	JUN 29-JUL 01, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	European Struct Integr Soc		Recycled Plastics; Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene; Polypropylene; Short Glass Fiber Reinforced; Mechanical Properties; Fatigue; Review		Plastics are used in a wide range of engineering applications in different industrial sectors like electronics, automotive, construction, packaging, white goods. Thanks to a combination of low-cost, ease of manufacturing and processing, excellent physical and chemical properties combined with adequate mechanical properties for structural applications, a tremendous and continuous increase in the consumption of polymer materials has occurred worldwide. However, the flip side of this ever-increasing consumption is the huge amount of waste, leading to deleterious environmental, health and economic impacts. Besides the use of recycled plastics, another important factor contributes to a material-efficient approach in the manufacturing industry; it is the mechanical design for 3D printing (or additive manufacturing), where minimum material usage complying with lightweight, stiffness and strength requirements is pursued by topology optimization. In this technical and economical international scenario, the present paper presents a bibliographic survey concerning the structural durability of additively manufactured recycled plastics and compounds. In particular, the paper is aimed at investigating the structural durability of three "families" of recycled plastics (rPlastic), i.e. rABS, rPP and rPP/glass fiber compound. Therefore, a literature survey regarding the considered materials will be presented by focusing on the influence of the 3D-printing process parameters on their mechanical and fatigue properties. Finally, a comparison between the results found in the literature of 3D-printed and traditionally manufactured polymers will be reported. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Particle shape and size analysis for metal powders used for additive manufacturing: Technique description and application to two gas-atomized and plasma-atomized Ti64 powders	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						X-ray computed tomography; Additive manufacturing; Metal powder; Selective laser melting; Electron beam melting; Powder bed; Titanium alloy; Ti64; Particle size distribution; Particle shape distribution	3-D SHAPE; COMPUTER VISION; PERCOLATION; TOMOGRAPHY; THRESHOLD	The particle size and shape distributions of metal powders used in additive manufacturing powder bed fusion processes are of technological importance for the final built product. Current three-dimensional (3D) measurements of these distributions assume a spherical shape, while techniques that measure both size and shape are always two-dimensional (2D) measurements of particle projections. This paper describes a set of techniques using X-ray computed tomography, combined with various mathematical algorithms, to measure the 3D size, shape, and internal porosity of individual particles. Calibrated by a limited amount of visual examination of 3D images of individual particles, these techniques can classify powder particles as single near-spherical (SnS) particles, and non-spherical (NS) particles, which consist of either single highly non-spherical particles or multi-particles, where two or more smaller particles have been joined together. From this 3D data, other algorithms can generate 2D particle size and shape information to compare with the results of 2D measurement techniques. These techniques are applied to two metal powders composed of a specific alloy of titanium with aluminum and vanadium, denoted as Ti64, which is in common use as a powder for selective laser or electron beam melting powder bed additive manufacturing. One powder was made with a gas-atomization process, the other with a plasma-atomization process, both have been recycled, and both pass the specifications for additive manufacturing use. The powders differ in the fraction of NS particles and porous particles, in their size and shape distributions, and in average shape and size statistics. The SnS/NS classification enables one to show how these classes contribute to the overall particle size distributions, even for a single powder type, and is useful for comparing different sources of powder as well as studying how the size/shape distributions of a powder might change over multiple recycling events.

The influences of additive amounts of Ce-rich alloys on the microstructure and magnetic properties of the recycled sintered magnets were investigated. It showed that the recycled sintered Nd-Fe-B magnet without Ce-rich alloy addition has rather lower density; the density of the magnet is slightly raised with increased sintering temperature, but the recycled magnet is prone to oxidation, even cracking. For recycled sintered magnets with Ce-rich alloy addition, the densities of the magnets are upgraded with increasing amounts of Ce-rich alloy, and the magnetic properties are obviously improved. This suggests that Ce-rich alloy plays the important role of sintering-aid in the densification of the recycled magnet. However, the coercivity (H-cj) of the recycled magnets is decreased, when the additive amounts of Ce-rich alloy are over 8 wt.%. This is probably because excessive Ce-rich alloy addition can cause RE-rich phase aggregation at the triple grain boundary junctions, and deteriorate the microstructure of the recycled magnets. The recycled magnet with 5 wt.% Ce-rich alloy, sintered at 1080 degrees C, exhibits the following optimal magnetic properties: B-r of 11.67 kGs; H-cj of 18.94 kOe; and maximum energy product [(BH)(max)] of 33.1 MGOe. The magnetic properties of the recycled magnets are comparative to those of the waste magnets. Recycled magnets have a higher coercivity and perfect squareness of demagnetization curve (H-k/H-cj = 0.972).

Thermoplastic composites offer an advantage of recyclability after their service life, but challenges and opportunities remain in the recycling of natural fiber reinforced polymer composites (NFRPCs). This article summarized the effects of reprocessing/recycling on the material properties of NFRPCs. The material properties considered include mechanical performance, thermal properties, hygroscopic behavior, viscoelasticity, degradation, and durability. NFRPCs can generally be recycled approximately 4-6 times until their thermomechanical properties change. After recycling 7 times, the tensile strength of NFRPCs can decrease by 17%, and the tensile modulus can decrease by 28%. The mitigation approaches to overcome degradation of material properties of NFRPCs such as adding functional additives and virgin plastics are also discussed. The main challenges in these approaches such as degradation and incompatibility are discussed, and an effort is made to provide a rationale for reprocessing/recyclability assessment. Future applications of NFRPCs such as additive manufacturing and automotive part use are discussed.

One of the solutions is the inclusion of a powder recycling strategy, allowing unused or exposed powder particles to be recuperated post manufacture, replenished and used for future builds. However, during a L-PBF process, powder particles are exposed to high levels of concentrated energy from the laser. Particularly those in close proximity to the melt pool, leading to the formation of spatter and agglomerated particles. These particles can settle onto the powder bed, which can then influence the particle size distribution and layer uniformity. This study analysed extra-low interstitial (ELI) Ti6Al4V (Grade 23) powder when subjected to nine recycle iterations, tracking powder property variation across the successive recycling stages. Characterisation included chemical composition focusing upon O, N, and H content, particle size distribution, morphology and tapped and bulk densities. On review of the compositional analysis, the oxygen content exceeded the 0.13% limit for the ELI grade after 8 recycles, resulting in the degradation from Grade 23 level.

This process alters the fiber structure and properties because of the repeated chemical and mechanical treatments that occur during wetting and drying. As a result, poor tensile strength is the main source of customer complaints to paper manufacturers. Cellulose nanofibers (CNF) from bleached eucalyptus and pine pulps were investigated as potential strength additives because of their proven contribution to interfiber bonding. These results were compared to the results obtained using different families of strength additives. The effects on the mechanical properties of recycled old corrugated containers were studied by measuring bursting, tensile, and short span compressive strength. Cellulose nanofibers and cationic polyacrylamide (cPAM) improved the mechanical strength properties when they were added at doses around 4 wt.%. A combination of CNF and cPAM was also tested. The effects of the combined additives were not as high as expected compared to the results achieved individually. The CNF from pine pulp resulted in the highest increase in bursting index when combined with cPAM, achieving an increase of over 93%. The combination of CNF from eucalyptus pulp and cPAM increased the bursting index over 60%.

ALIGNED VIRGIN AND RECYCLED SHORT CARBON FIBRE HYBRID COMPOSITES	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Composite Materials (ICCM)	JUL 19-24, 2015	Copenhagen, DENMARK			Recycled composites remanufacturing; Short fibres composites	POLYMER COMPOSITES; ALIGNMENT	One of the main problems in industrial applications of carbon composite materials is recycling end of life products. Usually chopped recycled fibres are randomly dispersed in materials as low-grade additives for non-structural applications; however, in order to maximize economic and functional viability, these fibres should be reused as reinforcement for high performance structural composites. The fibre alignment level is the key factor to increase the fibre volume fraction, and consequently the performance of recycled composites. Another important factor is the impact of the fibre recovery process on the mechanical properties of carbon fibres. Carbon fibres can be damaged during the fibre recovery process leading to a significant loss of strength, but the modulus is almost the same as that of virgin carbon fibres. The aim of this research is to manufacture intermingled hybrid composites using highly aligned new and recycled discontinuous carbon fibres with the HiPerDiF (High Performance Discontinuous Fibres) method to increase the availability of recycled carbon fibres. This method enables manufacturing of discontinuous fibre hybrid composites with different fibre mixing ratios; the constituents are intimately mixed and the hybridisation is achieved within the ply. In this work, the stiffness and the failure properties of aligned short fibre composites, as a function of the recycled to virgin carbon fibres ratio, are investigated. The HiPerDiF method proved to be a valuable remanufacturing method to achieve high performance short fibre composite from end of life recycled composites.

This paper presents a method for printing fiber-reinforced composite on the common fused filament fabrication (FFF) platform. Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers are used as printing materials. A spatial continuous toolpath planning strategy is employed to reduce the workload of post-processing without cutting the fiber. Experimental results show that this process not only enables the printing of models with complex geometric shapes but also supports material recycling and reuse. A material recovery rate of 100% for continuous PET fiber and 83% for PLA were achieved for a better environmental impact. Mechanical tests show that the maximum tensile strength of continuous PET fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites (PFRTPCs) is increased by 117.8% when compared to polyamide-66 (PA66).

J	Alsaadi, N				Alsaadi, Naiff			Prioritization of Challenges for the Effectuation of Sustainable Additive Manufacturing: A Case Study Approach	PROCESSES			English	Article						additive manufacturing; sustainable manufacturing; challenges; MCDM; G-TOPSIS	ADVANTAGES	Additive manufacturing (AM) is gaining significant importance, as demand for customized products is increasing nowadays. AM is one of the disruptive technologies of Industry 4.0, which can reduce waste generation, enabling sustainability. The adoption of sustainable practices in the manufacturing sector is due to the need of the current scenario to minimize harmful emissions and for human wellbeing. In this regard, AM technologies are integrated with sustainable manufacturing concepts to contribute toward sustainable AM (SAM), with various benefits from the design, manufacturing, use, and EoL perspectives. Still, many sustainability issues are associated with AM processes, namely limited speed and the uncertain performance of fabricated parts. From this viewpoint, it is essential to analyze the challenges associated with adopting SAM practices. This article presents identification and analysis of the potential challenges associated with adopting SAM practices. Fifteen SAM challenges have been identified from the literature survey and analyzed using the "Gray Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution" (G-TOPSIS) approach. The priority order of the challenges has been identified. The study identified that "training towards SAM benefits" and "limited materials recycling potential" were the significant challenges in adopting SAM practices in the manufacturing sector. The present study will help industry practitioners, decision makers, and researchers effectively analyze the challenges associated with SAM for its effective implementation. Researchers can utilize the findings of the study for establishing the guidelines for the adoption of SAM.

Additive manufacturing technologies have developed greatly over the last decade in terms of technology and printing materials. Special emphasis is placed on the development of cheaper materials derived from natural sources, without the release of harmful substances during the manufacturing process, with the possibility of using waste materials and recycling after service life. Wood or wood residues are among the potential raw materials that could be used for 3D printing in combinations with natural and synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that, with the development of additive technologies, the use of wood will also expand to the area of structural elements, such as in the construction of prefabricated houses. A review of publications on the topic of 3D printing with natural raw materials with an emphasis on wood biomass and technologies, where the use of wood particles is possible, was made. Some case studies of ongoing research as well as student's workshop on 3D printing design and developments will be presented.

Additive manufacturing of PA12 carbon nanotube composites with a novel laser polymer deposition process	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						composites; manufacturing; morphology; nanotubes; porous materials	BEHAVIOR; MICROSTRUCTURE; NANOCOMPOSITE; MECHANISM	The facile manufacture of PA12 MWCNT/silica (50/50 by weight) nanocomposite powders through a high energy mixing process is presented, which are useful to generate 3D objects by a novel Laser Polymer Deposition (LPD) process. The mixing as well as the LPD process led to no discernible changes in the material properties (DSC, SEM, LD) of the core-shell nanocomposites, enabling the recycling of unconverted powder. The built parts yield ultimate tensile stresses and Young's modulus at 10%-20% of the bulk material. Partially unmolten particles and voids were identified as the main mechanical failure mechanism in the built parts. The mechanical properties are better with low additive content (Young's modulus: 89.8 +/- 5.4 MPa; UTS: 12.9 +/- 5.3 MPa with 0.25 wt% additives). Electronic conductivity up to the region of moderate conductivity could be achieved by multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) network formation (8 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 1.25 wt% of additives). A variant of the processing strategy revealed that a higher mechanical strength can be achieved by a laser induced remelting of the traces following their initial construction.

Such materials are excellent candidates for distributed manufacturing, in which parts are printed from local materials at the point of need. Most plastic waste streams contain a mixture of polymers, such as water bottles and caps comprised of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP), and complete separation is rarely implemented. In this work, blends of waste PET, PP and polystyrene (PS) were processed into filaments for 3D printing. The effect of blend composition and styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) compatibilizer on the resulting mechanical and thermal properties were probed. Recycled PET had the highest tensile strength at 35 +/- 8 MPa. Blends of PP/PET compatibilized with SEBS and maleic anhydride functionalized SEBS had tensile strengths of 23 +/- 1 MPa and 24 +/- 1 MPa, respectively. The noncompatibilized PP/PS blend had a tensile strength of 22 +/- 1 MPa. PP/PS blends exhibited reduced tensile strength to ca. 19 +/- 1-3 MPa with the addition of SEBS. Elongation to failure was generally improved for the blended materials compared to neat recycled PET and PS. The glass transition was shifted to higher temperatures for all of the blends except the 50-50 wt. % PP/PET blend. Crystallinity was decreased for the blends, but was highest in the 75-25 wt. % PP/PS and the 50-50 wt. % PP/PET blend with SEBS-maleic anhydride. Solvent extraction of the dispersed phase revealed polypropylene was the matrix phase in both the 50-50 wt. % PP/PET and PP/PS blends.

J	Kavlak, G; Graedel, TE				Kavlak, Goksin; Graedel, T. E.			Global anthropogenic selenium cycles for 1940-2010	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Material flow analysis; Thin-film materials; Photovoltaics; CIGS; Recycling; Resource management	MULTILEVEL CYCLE; PHOTOVOLTAICS; AVAILABILITY	Selenium plays an important role in emerging thin film solar energy technologies. As solar energy is expected to have a larger share in the world's future energy portfolio, the long-term availability of selenium becomes a potential concern, yet no global cycles have ever been generated. In this work, the global cycles, stocks, and flows of selenium are characterized for the entire time period 1940-2010 by using principles of material flow analysis (MFA). The cycles present information on the production, fabrication and manufacturing, use, and resource management stages during that period. The results of the analysis show that during 1940-2010 approximately 90 Gg of refined selenium was produced and entered into fabrication and manufacturing worldwide. 60 Gg of this amount (two-thirds!) was dissipated into the environment through end-uses such as chemicals, pigments, glass manufacturing, metallurgical additives, and fertilizer and feed additives. The in-use stock of selenium is estimated at 2.7 Gg as of 2010. Because of data limitations such as proprietary and withheld information, these figures represent informed estimates rather than exact values. Selenium can be recovered from end-of-life electrical and electronic equipment, while for other end-uses recycling is difficult or impossible. One of the ways to buttress supplies of selenium for future technologies would be to deploy recycling schemes for photovoltaics as well as other electronics applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Pin Fin Array Heat Sinks by Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing: Economics of Powder Recycling	JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						cold spray; economics; heat sink; pin fin; powder recycling	GAS-DYNAMIC SPRAY	As a result of the rise in processing power demands of today's personal computers, water-cooled pin fin heat sinks are increasingly being employed for the cooling of graphical processing units. Currently, these high-performance devices are manufactured through high-cost, high-waste processes. In recent years, a new solution has emerged using the cold gas dynamic spray process, in which pin fins are manufactured onto a base plate by spraying metallic powder particles through a mask allowing for a high degree of adaptability to different graphics processing unit shapes and sizes. One drawback of this process is reduced deposition efficiency, resulting in a fair portion of the feedstock powder being wasted as substrate sensitivity to heat and mechanical residual stresses requires the use of reduced spray parameters. This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using powder recycling to mitigate this issue and compares coatings sprayed with reclaimed powder to their counterparts sprayed with as-received powder. The work demonstrates that cold gas dynamic spray is a highly flexible and economically competitive process for the production of pin fin heat sinks when using powder recycling. The heat transfer properties of the resulting fins are briefly addressed and demonstrated.

The comparative analysis was performed between two manufacturing processes using black recycled Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) pellets to evaluate the potential environmental impacts between Injection moulding and Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Unit Process Life Cycle Inventory (UPLCI) methodology were adopted, which resulted in an impact assessment separated by operation modes and subunits of the equipment. The LCA results indicate a lower environmental impact of the FDM when the aim is to produce a batch size smaller than 14 parts. For batch sizes above 50 parts, the Injection moulding process generated less impact to the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Cumulative Energy Demand (CED). The printing stage contributed the most to generating impacts for the FDM. In the Injection moulding process, the main responsible for generating impacts were the injection phase. Mechanical tensile tests were carried out with the parts obtained by the FDM with different infills (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%), and it was observed that parts with 100% infill obtained the best relation between mechanical properties and environmental impacts.

Recycling has failed to provide a practical solution for plastic waste disposal (60% of all plastics produced are discarded). It is difficult to achieve both durability and biodegradability in biodegradable plastics. In additive manufacturing processes, polylactic acid (PLA), one of the biodegradable plastics, is typically used, but it presents strength and durability problems. We developed novel additive manufactured biodegradable composite plastics by inserting continuous natural fibers (cotton, hemp, jute, etc.) into fabricated layers of PLA. The composite had a greater strength than normal additive manufactured PLA materials and could be used like a normal PLA filament in fused deposition modeling to create free-form three-dimensional objects. In this study, we performed experiments to evaluate the durability and biodegradability of the composite (PLA as matrix and hemp fibers as reinforcement). Specimens made from the composite were exposed to a normal indoor environment and to severe environments that products might encounter during use (presence of water and UV light (300-400 nm)). The decrease in strength over time was compared with that of PLA, and the durability was evaluated. The results indicated that the strength of the manufactured composite material exceeded that of PLA under all conditions. Whereas the stiffness of PLA exposed to UV light reduced significantly, that of the composite material remained constant, suggesting the significant effect of fiber reinforcement. In addition, test specimens were buried in a simulated soil environment, and their biodegradability was evaluated. The strength of the composite material decreased rapidly, and the biodegradability was confirmed to be at an acceptable level.

It is viewed as a promising technology to improve material efficiency and shorten manufacturing cycle. However, the energy-efficient manufacturing is not always achieved due to the huge electrical energy consumption in the manufacturing phase. It is not a simple "yes-or-no" question that ASHM process is more energy-saving than conventional subtractive manufacturing (CSM) process for production of a given part when considering the life cycle energy demand. For addressing this problem, this paper developed a decision-making model for quantitatively analyzing and comparing the energy demand of ASHM process and CSM process. The model takes into account the whole life cycle of the part, including pre-manufacturing phase, manufacturing phase, use phase, and end-of-life recycling. The critical variables of solid-to-envelope ratio, lightweight ratio, energy consumption reduction coefficient (ERC) are embedded in the model, and their synergistic effects on energy demand comparison are comprehensively analyzed. Moreover, the electrical specific energy consumption of the manufacturing phase was extrapolated as a function of the process parameters in the two manufacturing processes, and the unique relationship between specific energy consumption and process rate, laser power of the ASHM process is established, which can improve the generality of the decision-making model. The results indicated that parts used in aerospace are more suitable for production with ASHM process due to the lightweight and extremely high ERC, which leads to less energy consumption in the use phase compared to conventional manufactured parts. In static non-moving usage scenario, when the material recycling process is not considered, the manufacturing phase in ASHM process accounts for a large amount of total energy consumption, reached about 84%, while the material production in CSM process accounts for the largest proportion, reached almost 86%. In addition, process rate in ASHM process has an important effect on the electrical energy consumption in the manufacturing phase. By increasing the process rate from 1.5 to 5.5 g/min, the energy consumption of the manufacturing phase in ASHM process was saved by 38%. This work provides a quantitative method for decision-makers to select the sustainable manufacturing process when producing a functional part.

It is known that additive manufacturing systems are making great progress in all professional areas and that companies are adapting their resources to new technologies. With the arrival of the new era, in this case, 3D manufacturing, we can design almost any type of product, with any material, solving the problems characteristic of conventional manufacturing processes. With this new technique, we design an object creating its model on the computer and manufacture it, no matter how complex its design. In addition, on-site and on-demand printing means savings in transport and storage costs. A single 3D printer is capable of making many different products. Much of the current manufacturing is done with specific machines whose function is limited and if the product changes, the machine must also be readjusted or changed. This is why the P.T.M.P. (Printed thermoplastic modular piece), which are constructive modules, which do not allow any vertical wall to be executed within a building. One of the main advantages of these pieces is the possibility of using recycled materials in their elaboration, such as plastics, contributing to the sustainability of the planet having special respect and commitment to the environment and making efficient use of material resources. In the same way, the non-generation of waste decreases the costs of production in material losses, as well as those derived from the environmental waste plan.

Design/methodology/approach The qualitative research method was deployed in three stages. Stage 1 was a literature review of concepts, successful factors and barriers related to the transition towards a CE along with sustainable supply chain management, smart production systems and additive manufacturing (AM). Stage 2 comprised a conceptual framework to integrate and evaluate the synergistic potential among these concepts. Finally, stage 3 validated the proposed model by collecting rich qualitative data based on semi-structured interviews with managers, researchers and professors of operations management to gather insightful and relevant information. Findings The outcome of the study is the recommendation of a circular model to reuse scrap electronic devices, integrating web technologies, reverse logistics and AM to support CE practices. Results suggest a positive influence from improving business sustainability by reinserting waste into the supply chain to manufacture products on demand. Social implications The purpose of this study was to explore how Industry 4.0 technologies are integrated with CE practices. This allows for the proposal of a circular business model for recycling waste and delivering new products, significantly reducing resource consumption and optimising natural resources. In a first stage, the circular business model can be used to recycle electronic scrap, with the proposed integration of web technologies, reverse logistics and AM as a technological platform to support the model. These have several environmental, sociotechnical and economic implications for society. Originality/value The sociotechnical aspects are directly impacted by the circular smart production system (CSPS) management model, since it creates a new culture of reuse and recycling techniques for urban waste using 3D printing technologies, as well as Industry 4.0 concepts to increase production on demand and automate manufacturing processes. The tendency of the CSPS model is to contribute to deployment CE in the manufacture of new products or parts with AM approaches, generating a new path of supply and demand for society.

In addition, they offered mechanical properties within the range of other additively manufactured counterparts. TEM showed that the microstructure of the as-built samples comprised of cell-like structures featured by dislocation networks and Si precipitates. HRTEM studies revealed the semi-coherency characteristics of the Si precipitates. After deformation, the dislocation density increased as a result of generation of new dislocations due to dislocation motion. The dislocations bypassed the precipitates by bowing around them and penetrating the semi-coherent precipitates. Strengthening of recycled DMLS-AlSi10Mg alloys manufactured in both directions was attributed to Orowan mechanism (due to existence of Si precipitates), Hall-Petch effect (due to eutectic cell walls), and dislocation hardening (due to pre-existing dislocation networks). Due to the slightly different microstructure, the contribution of each strengthening mechanism was slightly different in identical samples made with virgin powder.

The study starts with a lifecycle assessment of conventional PCB production. Then, the alternative materials of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polylactic acid (PLA)/glass fiber composite and paper are investigated for the substrate. A conventional PCB adopts copper as the conductive material and requires an etching process. The environmental impacts of changing the conductive deposition method to an additive method by printing silver nanoparticles is studied. In a conventional PCB, electricity generation contributes 41% of the global warming potential (GWP) and 38% of the abiotic resource depletion (ADP), in the fossil category. By applying an additive manufacturing method, the GWP of PCB manufacturing can be reduced to 14% of that of the conventional method. A sensitivity analysis of silver recycling illustrates that a 40% higher silver recycling rate would decrease the GWP of silver material by about 48-60%. Uncertainty in the energy consumption of PCB production would alter the environmental impacts; however, even with the most conservative energy consumption in a conventional PCB production method, the environmental impacts of the additive method are about five times lower than those of conventional PCB production.

The amount of brominated flame retardant (mainly tetrabromobisphenol-A) leached in curing water of RPAs was quantified using extraction with an organic solvent and gas chromatography methods (CG-FID). A clear relationship can be established between the characteristics of the stabilizing additive used and the amount of tetrabromobisphenol-A and bisphenol-A leached. The additive used was activated carbon, which in a manufacture scale may be provided by different suppliers with different mesoporous characteristics, which can be easily determined by the iodine number. The analysis proposed can be an effective way to determine if a particular activated carbon can be used as stabilizing additive in the production of RPAs with the developed technology.

This review paper aims to promote awareness of the sources of carbon footprint in the construction industry, from design to operation and management during manufacturing, transportation, construction, operations, maintenance and management, and end-of-life deconstruction phases. In addition, it summarizes the latest studies on carbon footprint reduction strategies in different phases of construction by the use of alternative additives in building materials, improvements in design, recycling construction waste, promoting the utility of alternative water resources, and increasing efficiencies of water technologies and other building systems. It was reported that the application of alternative additives/materials or techniques/systems can reduce up to 90% of CO2 emissions at different stages in the construction and building operations. Therefore, this review can be beneficial at the stage of conceptualization, design, and construction to assist clients and stakeholders in selecting materials and systems; consequently, it promotes consciousness of the environmental impacts of fabrication, transportation, and operation.

Recycled powder therefore can have a negative impact on process quality. In this study, AISI 904L stainless steel powder is recycled up to ten times. The powder is analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and by measuring chemical composition, flowability and particle size distribution in order to examine changes in properties due to recycling. Furthermore, electrical impedance spectroscopy was introduced as a potential method to determine surface oxides on powder particles due to handling and recycling. The recycled powder shows a significant increase in flowability. Furthermore no significant changes of powder properties such as chemical composition and particle size distribution can be found after ten recycling steps, resulting in comparable density and mechanical properties of printed parts. Therefore the present powder material shows an excellent recyclability. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The recycled stainless-steel scrap was gas-atomized using a novel mobile foundry manufactured by MolyWorks Materials Corporation. The powder was thermally treated based upon thermodynamic modeling using Thermo-Calc. The powder and sprayed specimens were characterized using particle size-shape analysis, microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and nanoindentation. Diffraction results highlighted the presence of both austenite and ferrite phases in the powder. Nanoindentation confirmed that thermally processing the feedstock powder at the austenitization temperature decreased the amount of ferrite present, which was consistent with the porosity observed in the deposits due to the lower yield strength of austenite relative to ferrite. The untreated powder deposits exhibited extensive porosity and microcracking, as opposed to the virtually fully dense deposit from the heat-treated powder.

The possibility for utilizing this polystyrene product waste to act as a low profile additive was investigated. Low-profile thermoplastic additives are primarily employed to limit the volume shrinkage during curing of unsaturated polyester composites. A novel process has been developed to recycle polystyrene foam by dissolving it in non-volatile soybean oil esters in place of styrene. This substitution eliminates the environmentally unfriendly vapors emitted by styrene without significantly jeopardizing the composite properties, The resin systems were systematically compared in terms of pertinent chemical and mechanical properties. Polyester resin systems augmented with soy oil esters - polystyrene showed improved elongation than the unmodified polyester resins, because the co-polymer is more flexible than the conventional polyester resin. Natural fiber-reinforced composites based on the low profile resin systems were successfully manufactured. Finally, mechanical and chemical properties were tested for comparison with virgin polyester resin.

A large amount of powders are not sintered during the SLS forming of polyamide 2200 (PA2200), and the reuse of the unsintered powders is important for reducing the cost. However, the high temperature during the SLS process changes the performance of unsintered powders, and the effect of powder recycling on the properties of the formed samples is not yet clear. The influences of powder recycling times on hardness and impact toughness of the sintered samples are systematically investigated with the help of EOS P110 system and EOS PA2200 powders. The results show that the melting point of the recycled powders increases with the increase of recycling times of the powders. When the recycling times exceeds two, the unmelted powders and pores inside the formed samples increase, and the toughness and hardness of the formed samples decrease. When the recycling times of powders is less than two, the impact toughness of the formed samples declines slightly and its hardness increases.

It shows great potential in reducing the need for energy- and resource-intensive manufacturing processes, which in turn reduces the amount of material required in the supply chain, and enables more environmentally benign practices. However, the question of how to realize these potential benefits has received little attention. This paper aims to provide an overview of the Sustainability of Additive Manufacturing (SAM). The context of the SAM is introduced, with a focus on energy and environmental impacts. Resource consumption is identified as the most important aspect. Examination from a life cycle perspective is also presented, with explicit discussions on opportunities to reduce energy and material consumption through design, material preparation, manufacturing, usage, and end-of-life treatment. Statistical data analysis provides an overview of impact forecasts, highlighting the importance of and need for thorough research on sustainability. The eco-design concept enabled by AM is identified as the most promising and effective technology, further extending and completing its design capability. This also determines the opportunities for energy and environmental optimization in subsequent processes. Most existing research is in process- and system-specific modeling, and few AM processes and systems have been studied, with generally premature conclusions. General models for each type of AM process are still necessary. Lastly, five research priorities are suggested: improve systematic data integration and management, correlate energy and quality, develop intelligent machinery, focus on material preparation and recycling, and discover innovative applications using AM.

The aim of the present research work is to study the effects of the additive to the electrolyte Benzyl benzoate (BB) (C6H5CH2O2CC6H5) on the structure and composition of the electrode active masses of lead batteries through physicochemical characterization. It is investigated how this additive can facilitate the recycling of the negative active mass after the end of the lifecycle of lead batteries. 5 Ah cells were subjected High-Rate Partial-State-of-Charge cycling test. After reaching their end-of-life criteria, the test cells were dismantled and samples were taken from the active masses and subjected to various analyses, including chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. It has been established that the additive Benzyl benzoate exhibits most strongly its inhibiting effect on the processes of PbSO4 crystal growth when added to the electrolyte at concentration levels of 0.3% and 0.5%. The inhibiting action of the additive manifests in impeding the growth of PbSO4 crystals during the recrystallization process by facilitating the formation of small sized PbSO4 crystals with high solubility.

The repeated feedstock use caused the particle size distribution, particle morphology, and oxygen content to change in comparison to virgin powder. Unusual particle morphologies were observed in the powder with repeated use when compared to virgin gas-atomized feedstock. Particles after use were found to contain surface features such as films and spots, which consisted of aluminum oxides and likely contributed to increasing the oxygen content in the recycled feedstock powder.

Some studies have been reported in recent past on recycling of thermoplastics via three-dimensional (3D) printing as a novel technique under primary and secondary recycling. But hitherto no work has been reported on use of recycled/virgin thermoplastics for use as energy storage devices (ESD). In this paper an effort has been made to develop in house ESD in form of dry cell by printing with low cost fused deposition modeling (FDM) based commercial open source 3D printer. The feed stock filament of FDM has been prepared by twin screw extrusion (TSE) comprising of advanced composite materials (thermoplastic: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) matrix, reinforced with different proportions of chemicals/salts namely: MnO2, ZnCl2, NH4Cl and graphite), which has been used to print dry cell for energy storage applications. The commercial dry cell consists of four zones/sections and feed stock filaments for three zones have been prepared separately on TSE (with different proportions of ABS and reinforcement of chemical/salts) and fourth zone (of Zn metal) has been tasted with conventional sand casting route. Finally, all four zones have been assembled in series to develop fully functional prototype of ESD. This study highlights that with the proposed methodology, dry cell comprising of minimum 40% by weight recycled thermoplastics can be prepared successfully having voltage potential at par with commercial dry cell. Another major advantage of using this novel route is that the ESD prepared is more thermally stable (confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis) and can operate up to 95 degrees C temperature. Along with this the ESD so prepared has better rheological, mechanical properties (tensile, surface hardness) ensuring it to be useable under severe loading conditions. The results are also supported by photomicrographs.

A prototype of a lower tail gate has been manufactured by means of this innovative technology to demonstrate the potential for joining plastic components in automotive and aerospace applications. Monitoring of nanoparticles release during preparation of modified adhesives shows very low environmental impact if the mixing process is performed under a fume hood. The innovative electromagnetic bonding process can provide to the manufacturing industry new opportunities in terms of simplification of productive lay-out, more flexible design and process rapidity, in addition to significant economic benefit. The reversibility of the process would also increase the chances for part reuse and/or recycling that would otherwise be discarded.

During MAM, metal parts are produced in a layer by layer fashion using 3D computer-aided design models. The advantages of using this technology include the reduction of materials waste, high efficiency for small production runs, near net shape manufacturing, ease of change or revision of versions of a product, support of lattice structures, and rapid prototyping. Numerous metals and alloys can nowadays be processed by additive manufacturing techniques. Among them, Al-based alloys are of great interest in the automotive and aeronautic industry due to their relatively high strength and stiffness to weight ratio, good wear and corrosion resistance, and recycling potential. The special conditions associated with the MAM processes are known to produce in these materials a fine microstructure with unique directional growth features far from equilibrium. This distinctive microstructure, together with other special features and microstructural defects originating from the additive manufacturing process, is known to greatly influence the corrosion behaviour of these materials. Several works have already been conducted in this direction. However, several issues concerning the corrosion and corrosion protection of these materials are still not well understood. This work reviews the main studies to date investigating the corrosion aspects of additively manufactured aluminium alloys. It also provides a summary and outlook of relevant directions to be explored in future research.

Water was added as the kneading material, and Opuntia ficus-indica extract (mucilage) was supplemented as a natural additive to improve the workability of the mixtures. The conventional firing process was substituted by drying in a solar drying chamber. Nine mixtures were prepared using 62% excavation wastes, 5% wood-cutting residues and 33% RA. These mixtures were classified into two groups depending on their granulometries: the first one denominated cementitious RA only having granulometries from 3/8 inch (0.95 cm) and 1/4 inch (0.63 cm) to fines and the second group denominated all-in-one RA having granulometries from 1/4 inch to fines. The quality of the sustainable bricks was evaluated according to compressive strength and water absorption parameters. The results showed that the ecological bricks manufactured with the mixture of cementing RA only of 3/8 and 1/4 inch to fines meet the standard requirements, providing compressive strength values of up to 8 MPa; moreover, the use of O. ficus-indica extract as a natural additive notably improved the workability of the mixture.

A sustainable manufacturing process was used in which the clay material typically used in the traditional manufacturing of adobe bricks was replaced by excavation wastes of originally unknown composition obtained during the construction of two buildings, in order to investigate whether various excavation wastes having appropriate clay contents can be used as raw materials for manufacturing sustainable adobe bricks. Before using these wastes, preliminary particle size distribution, plasticity and hardness tests were performed in order to determine the appropriate residue dosages for manufacturing adobe bricks. The results have shown that the use of excavation wastes different from the clay soil usually used ensures the quality requested by the Mexican standard for non-structural adobe bricks. Currently, further studies are being conducted to promote their use in building elements.

More specifically, LDPE films for food packaging have been treated with atmosphere corona discharge plasma for electrochemical detection of glucose. Enzyme-functionalized sensors manufactured using such recycled materials, which act as a mediator capable of electrocommunicating with the glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme, are able to detect glucose concentrations in sweat and are fully compatible with the levels of such bioanalytes in both healthy and diabetic patients. Covalent immobilization of the GOx enzyme on the plasma-treated LDPE films has been successfully performed using the carbodiimide method, as proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Then, the electronic communication between the deeply buried active site of the GOx and the reactive excited species formed at the surface of the plasma-treated LDPE has been demonstrated by linear sweep voltammetry. Finally, cyclic voltammetry in artificial sweat has been used to show that the LDPE-functionalized sensor has a linear response in the concentration of range of 50 mu M to 1 mM with a limit of detection of 375 mu A.mu M-1 .cm(-2). Comparison of the performance of sensors prepared using recycled (i.e. with additives) and pristine (i.e. without additives) LDPE indicates that the utilization of the former does not require any pretreatment to eliminate additives. The present strategy demonstrates a facile approach for recycling LDPE waste into a high value-added product, which will potentially pave the way for the treatment of plastic waste in the future. Noninvasive glucose sensors based on recycled LDPE may play a crucial role in monitoring diabetes in underdeveloped regions.

Spattering and oxidation phenomena during recycling of low alloy steel powder in Laser Powder Bed Fusion	MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Low alloy steel; Spattering; Powder degradation; Recycling; Laser powder bed fusion; Additive manufacturing	316L STAINLESS-STEEL; MELT-POOL BEHAVIOR; METALLIC POWDER; GENERATION; MECHANISMS; TI-6AL-4V; DYNAMICS	This study reports on the impact of repeated powder recycling on the degradation of low alloy steel powder in Laser Powder Bed Fusion. The average powder particle size increased slightly upon recycling due to powder agglomeration and the presence of spatters and other ejecta from the process zone. The oxygen content showed a continuous growth after each recycle, while the other chemical elements of the recycled powder remained largely unchanged. A map of ejecta classification is presented, featuring various ejecta types formed during laser processing. Ejecta of increased diameter and different shapes were observed in the recycled powder, using high-speed imaging and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The ejecta were collected after each powder recycle to enable the calculation of the ejecta mass generated during the process. The result showed a direct correlation between oxygen content in the powder and spatter/ejecta formation with the number of recycling events. It is likely that the increase in oxygen contributes to powder spattering.	[Fedina, Tatiana; Sundqvist, Jesper; Kaplan, Alexander F.

It is designed, built, and tested for its ability to convert post-consumer waste, 3D printed products and waste into polymer feedstock for recyclebots of fused particle/granule printers. The technical specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less than $2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed recycling of waste plastic. The resultant plastic particle size distributions were found to be appropriate for use in both recyclebots and direct material extrusion 3D printers. Simple retrofits are shown to reduce sound levels during operation by 4dB-5dB for the vacuum. These results indicate that the open source waste plastic granulator is an appropriate technology for community, library, maker space, fab lab, or small business-based distributed recycling.

J	Kim, H; Lee, S				Kim, Hyungjin; Lee, Sangkyu			Printability and physical properties of iron slag powder composites using material extrusion-based 3D printing	JOURNAL OF IRON AND STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Slag; By-product; Mechanical property; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing	STAINLESS-STEEL; MICROSTRUCTURE; NANOCOMPOSITES; POLYMER; MODEL	There have been many studies on three-dimensional (3D) printing using metal compounds. However, 3D printing using a metal compound has disadvantages in that it increases the cost for supplying metal materials. A method of using slag which is a recyclable material has been proposed to reduce costs. With the growing demand for additive manufacturing using by-products, slag has gained attention as a diverse recycling material for 3D printing technologies. A new fabrication approach was analyzed for producing porous bodies via additive manufacturing for blending slag and reinforced metals. However, because of its low quality due to low strength, low durability, and structural defeats, the amount of slag generated is high, and its usability remains uncertain. Also, slag is an excellent material with a huge potential for producing structures with high mechanical properties, and limited research in the area of slag recycling has been conducted due to difficulties in sintering the iron by-products. To develop a recycling approach that utilizes slag in 3D printing powders, a study to increase the industrial usability by mixing slag and ceramic beads was described. A method was presented to compare the physical properties of 3D printed slag parts with the physical properties of those generated by blending iron slag, alumina, and zirconia. In order to find the mixing ratio with the optimum physical properties, the average particle size, bending stress, and maximum compressive stress were tested. The combination ratio to obtain the highest strength was when iron slag powder was 40% and alumina was 60%. In addition, the specimens by composition to which the stress test was applied were cut to analyze the tissue under a microscope. It is thought that cracking in the sintered structure decreases and density increases by mixing alumina and zirconium, contributing to increased strength. When a ceramic bead composed of alumina and zirconium is mixed with slag to form a composite material, a metal compound having a level of physical properties that can be used as a material for 3D printing can be produced. Furthermore, a novel concept of producing lightweight structural materials via additive manufacturing, which entails a fabrication process whereby high-strength metals are stacked inside hollow base steels, was proposed.

The effects of powder reuse on the mechanical response of electron beam additively manufactured Ti6Al4V parts	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Electron beam powder bed fusion; Powder reuse; Powder characteristics; Build properties	TI-6AL-4V POWDER; MICROSTRUCTURE; RECYCLABILITY; METALLURGY; COMPONENTS; FEEDSTOCK; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; DEFECTS	High cost of metal powders has increased the demand for recycling of unmelted powder in electron beam powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process. However, powder characteristics are likely to change during manufacturing, recovery and reuse. It is important to track the evolution of powder characteristics at different stages of recycling to produce components with consistent properties. The present work evaluates the changes in Ti6Al4V powder properties during manufacturing by characterising powder particles at different locations in the powder bed; recovery and reuse, through evaluating the effects of the powder recovery system and sieving for 10 build cycles. Heterogeneous powder degradation occurred during manufacturing with the particles closer to the melt zone showing higher oxygen content and thicker alpha laths with beta phase boundaries. Most of them had a hardsintered and agglomerated powder morphology in contrast to particles at the edges of the powder bed. Recovery and reuse resulted in a refined particle size distribution, but only marginal change in powder morphology. The increased oxygen caused a slight increase in the yield and tensile strengths of the build. The effect of powder reuse on material elongation, hardness and Charpy impact energy was negligible. The high cycle fatigue performance deteriorated with reuse due to the increased lack-of-fusion defects. This might be attributed to the voids formed in the powder bed due to decrease in the number of fine particles coupled with an increase in the number of high-aspect ratio particles.

Dumping this waste product incurs a considerable cost to a paper recycling mill. In this study a sample of waste containing 45% fibrous and 55% non-fibrous solid was collected from an old corrugating containers paper-recycling mill and analyzed in a laboratory. The waste was used to produce wastes-urea formaldehyde composites and wastes-polyethylene composites. Physical and mechanical properties of the resulting manufactured panels were compared with commercially produced medium density fiberboard and particle board. The results presented the possibility of panel production from waste, even without inclusion of any additional material. Additives would obviously enhance the physical and mechanical characteristics of a product to render it more competitive with commercially produced panels. The results also revealed that water absorbability and thickness swelling of panels were much less compared with similar commercially available products. The mechanical characteristics of the manufactured panels were weaker relative to the commercially available ones, probably due to differences in density and thickness. Hence, wastes-urea formaldehyde composites and wastes-polyethylene composites panels can be recommended for application if physical properties are more important than mechanical properties.

J	Mehat, NM; Kamaruddin, S				Mehat, Nik Mizamzul; Kamaruddin, Shahrul			Optimization of mechanical properties of recycled plastic products via optimal processing parameters using the Taguchi method	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Virgin PP; Recycled PP; Blend; Injection moulding; Taguchi method; Flexural properties; MEI	MOLDED PART; SHRINKAGE; WARPAGE; POLYPROPYLENE; BEHAVIOR; ANOVA; HDPE	The large amount of plastic products presently produced necessitates recycling and reuse of these non-biodegradable materials. However, the degradation in the mechanical properties of products made from recycled plastic is a major drawback that limits their use. This study aims to improve the mechanical properties of products made from recycled plastic by utilizing the Taguchi optimization method, instead of coupling the products with additives. By adopting L-9 Taguchi OA, products made from various compositions of virgin and recycled plastic are produced by injection moulding. Four controllable factors (i.e., melt temperature, packing pressure, injection time, and packing time), each at three levels, are tested to determine the optimal combination of factors and levels in the manufacturing process. By determining the optimal combination of factors and levels, the appropriate blending ratio of virgin and recycled plastic can be evaluated from the mechanical performance exhibited by the compound. The effects of the optimal processing parameters and the addition of recycled plastic in various compositions on the mechanical properties and melt flow index of the produced parts are also investigated. The results reveal that the product made of 25% recycled polypropylene (PP) and 75% virgin PP exhibits a better flexural modulus compared to the virgin form. The same product exhibits a 3.4% decrease in flexural strength. The degradation in mechanical properties of products produced from recycled plastic can be improved by optimizing the influence processing parameters during the manufacturing process.

Life cycle analysis of distributed recycling of post-consumer high density polyethylene for 3-D printing filament	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Distributed recycling; Life cycle analysis; Plastic; Polymer; Recycling; Transportation energy	WASTE MANAGEMENT; ASSESSMENT LCA; DEBRIS	The growth of desktop 3-D printers is driving an interest in recycled 3-D printer filament to reduce costs of distributed production. Life cycle analysis studies were performed on the recycling of high density polyethylene into filament suitable for additive layer manufacturing with 3-D printers. The conventional centralized recycling system for high population density and low population density rural locations was compared to the proposed in home, distributed recycling system. This system would involve shredding and then producing filament with an open-source plastic extruder from post-consumer plastics and then printing the extruded filament into usable, value-added parts and products with 3-D printers such as the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper, or RepRap. The embodied energy and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated for high density polyethylene recycling using SimaPro 7.2 and the database Ecolnvent v2.0. The results showed that distributed recycling uses less embodied energy than the best-case scenario used for centralized recycling. For centralized recycling in a low-density population case study involving substantial embodied energy use for transportation and collection these savings for distributed recycling were found to extend to over 80%. If the distributed process is applied to the U.S. high density polyethylene currently recycled, more than 100 million MJ of energy could be conserved per annum along with the concomitant significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It is concluded that with the open-source 3-D printing network expanding rapidly the potential for widespread adoption of in-home recycling of post-consumer plastic represents a novel path to a future of distributed manufacturing appropriate for both the developed and developing world with lower environmental impacts than the current system.

E-Waste includes plastics and metals, which are highly recyclable but which, if not adequately managed, are concerned about the health and the environment by plastic waste and heavy metal traces of additives and chemicals. This article investigates the modeling of game theory for E-Waste. It presents a framework to analyze various stakeholders' behavior in the manufacture of electronic products using recycled (ERM) and non-recycled (ENRM) materials, understanding the importance of the actual cost variation. This study suggested a framework to decide which Game Plan is best-suited to gain each stakeholder's leading company's profit allocation. Data demonstrate that ERM can be the best choice for manufacturers and customers and recommend applying return schemes to consumers with specific incentives and penalties to those who do not comply with the agreed E-Waste management process could be of great help to discourage computer waste disposal on land.

Several studies have recently investigated 3D printing of poly lactic acid (PLA) with biomass resources like cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and whole biomass. Such biodegradable composites are better for the environment and can be used to replace non-biodegradable composites in a variety of applications. Therefore, a deep understanding of printing such biocomposites is needed for supporting such manufacturing. Recent developments focused on FDM printing of PLA filled with biomass resources have been critically reviewed to reveal the intricate aspects of manufacturing of such materials and characterization of the changes caused by biomass-based fillers. Properties of high molecular weight PLA, essentials of printing with PLA and conditions for filament extrusion and printing of biocomposites are discussed. Characterization results from mechanical testing, thermal analysis, viscoelastic properties, imaging and spectroscopy are reviewed for understanding the impact of filling biomass resources in PLA by printing. The latter sections discuss applications, upcycling & recycling and future opportunities for biorefineries. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mele, M; Ricciarelli, M; Campana, G				Mele, Mattia; Ricciarelli, Michele; Campana, Giampaolo			3D printing of clay paste enhanced by scrap polymer from powder bed processes	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Additive manufacturing; Recycling; Material extrusion; Clay; Polymer powder	MULTI JET FUSION; POLYAMIDE 12; FUSED DEPOSITION; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGIES; CERAMICS; CRACKING; DESIGN	Purpose Powder bed additive manufacturing processes are widespread due to their many technical and economic advantages. Nevertheless, the disposal of leftover powder poses a problem in terms of process sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative solution to recycle waste PA12 powder from HP multi jet fusion. In particular, the opportunity to use this material as a dispersion in three-dimensional (3D) printed clay is investigated. Design/methodology/approach A commercial fused deposition modelling printer was re-adapted to extrude a viscous paste composed of clay, PA12 and water. Once printed, parts were dried and then put in an oven to melt the polymer fraction. Four compositions with different PA12 concentration were studied. First, the extrudability of the paste was observed by testing different extrusion lengths. Then, the surface porosities were evaluated through microscopical observations of the manufactured parts. Finally, benchmarks with different geometries were digitalised via 3D scanning to analyse the dimensional alterations arising at each stage of the process. Findings Overall, the feasibility of the process is demonstrated. Extrusion tests revealed that the composition of the paste has a minor influence on the volumetric flow rate, exhibiting a better consistency in the case of long extrusions. The percentage of surface cavities was proportional to the polymer fraction contained in the mix. From dimensional analyses, it was possible to conclude that PA12 reduced the degree of shrinkage during the drying phase, while it increased dimensional alterations occurring in the melting phase. The results showed that the dimensional error measured on the z-axis was always higher than that of the XY plane. Practical implications The method proposed in this paper provides an alternative approach to reuse leftover powders from powder bed fusion processes via another additive manufacturing process. This offers an affordable and open-source solution to companies dealing with polymer powder bed fusion, allowing them to reduce their environmental impacts while expanding their production. Originality/value The paper presents an innovative additive manufacturing solution for powder reuse. Unlike the recycling methods in the body of literature, this solution does not require any intermediate transformation process, such as filament fabrication.

Powder reuse is posited to have immediate cost savings, such as for the orthopedic industry. However, process deviation in the medical device industry requires that both material and part quality be quantitatively assessed with respect to reuse. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation at break (EaB) were measured from selective laser sintered nylon specimens printed with recovered build chamber powder reused 1, 4 and 8 times. Using a design of experiment approach, build temperature, layer thickness, laser speed and laser power were confirmed to influence UTS. Statistical analysis revealed that location in the bed influences UTS, but not EaB. UTS decreased significantly between Reuse 1 and 4, but not between Reuse 4 and 8, whereas EaB (evaluated with the non-parametric Friedman's test) was unaffected for both pairwise comparisons (p>0.05). A 50-50 blend demonstrated a diminished effect on UTS and further suggests that the use of recycled powder in sintered nylon part are 'rescued' with the addition of the virgin material.

Cold gas dynamic manufacturing: A non-thermal approach to freeform fabrication	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						cold spray; embedded devices; helium recycling; moulds; sacrificial materials; titanium	SPRAY PROCESS; DEPOSITION; COMPONENTS; EFFICIENCY; VELOCITY; POWDER; ART	This paper reports on the development of a novel freeform fabrication technique using a cold spray (CS) system. In the CS process, metallic powder particles are accelerated in a supersonic gas jet and impacted with a substrate at speeds in excess of 600 m/s. The non-melting nature of its deposition mechanism ensures that the sprayed material is free from thermally induced tensile stresses, while the underlying substrate remains unchanged. The process is seen as a viable method for additive manufacturing because of its high deposition rates and controllable spray jet. A process was developed to investigate the potential of non-thermal freeform fabrication and was coined Cold Gas Dynamic Manufacturing (CGDM). Here, additive and subtractive techniques were combined to enable the production of complex geometries. Whereas most CS facilities concentrate on the application of wear or corrosion-resistant coatings, CGDM is dedicated to the production of freeform components, whilst still retaining an inherent coating ability. The process can produce functional forms using novel manufacturing strategies that are unique to CS. This paper presents information on the process, and details the various strategies employed during component fabrication. It was possible to construct components from many materials, including titanium, which exhibited freeform surfaces, internal channels and embedded devices. A breakdown of the process economics is also provided, with and without helium recycling. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Review on direct metal laser deposition manufacturing technology for the Ti-6Al-4V alloy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						DLMS; Process variables; Powder recycling; Ti-6Al-4V; LAM	PROCESSING PARAMETERS; POWDER; MICROSTRUCTURE; MODEL; TITANIUM; BEHAVIOR	Direct laser metal deposition (DLMD) is a breaking edge laser-based additive manufacturing (LAM) technique with the possibility of changing the perception of design and manufacturing as a whole. It is well suitable for building and repairing applications in the aerospace industry which usually requires high level of accuracy and customization of parts; this technique enables the fabrication of materials known to pose difficulties during processing such as titanium alloys. Ti-6Al-4V, which is the most employed titanium-based alloy is one of the materials that are most explored for additive manufacturing process. However, this process is currently at its pioneer stage and very little is known about the fundamental metallurgy and physio-chemical basis that govern the process. Currently, the major problems faced in additive manufacturing include evolution of residual stresses leading to deformed parts and formation of defects such as pores and cracks which are detrimental to the quality of deposits. The presence of these unwanted defects on additively manufactured parts depends on the complex mechanisms taking place in the melt pool during melting, cooling, and solidification which are dependent on processing variables. In addition, during fabrication, some feedstock powder does not melt and thus does not make up part of the final product. The present text entails classification of LAM technologies, operational principles of DLMD, feedstock quality requirements, material laser interaction mechanism, and metallurgy of Ti-6AL-4V alloy.

The present investigation focuses on the analysis of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (RPET) analyzing whether it is possible to modify the thermal behavior of this plastic, by adding flame retardant, with the aim of improving its thermal properties. The thermal properties of the mixture and the degradation were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Dynamic Thermal Analysis (DTA), characterizing its decomposition process in increase of temperature, showing the little variation of the behavior of the mixture of RPET and % of MCA as a flame retardant additive compared to virgin PET.

The powder characterization results demonstrated a 22% increase in the number of coarse particles (> 30 mu m) and an 18.2% reduction in the number of small particles (< 10 mu m) after recycling up to 16 times. A few elongated and irregular-shaped particles were found after recycling, possibly due to particle agglomeration during handling and sieving. A negligible increase in the oxygen content by 0.036% was detected in the recycled powder. The density of sintered parts produced using recycled powder was approximately 1.5% lower than when using fresh powder due to the changes in the particle size distribution and the flowability of the powder caused by the changes in morphology. Final parts built using fresh and recycled powder showed similar hardness (155 +/- 3 HV and 165 +/- 9 HV) and yield strength (206 +/- 16 MPa and 192 +/- 10 MPa), respectively.

Since the high cost of the feedstock powder, the un-melted powder is often recycled in the subsequent process. In this study, the influence of powder reuse on the surface characteristics of Ti-6Al-4V powder is examined using a variety of technology including scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Auger electron spectroscopy. The modification of surface morphology and chemistry either generally or locally are revealed and discussed, which helps the creation of powder recycling strategy. Compared with fresh virgin powder, "worn" and rougher powder particles are observed after recycling. Meanwhile, the average oxide thickness is slightly increased, and less Al enrichment was found at the surface. Locally varied chemistry/oxide thickness on different powder particles or different location on the same particle is observed.

Surface Oxide State on Metal Powder and its Changes during Additive Manufacturing: an Overview	METALLURGIA ITALIANA			English	Article						OXIDES; LS PROCESS; SEM; OXIDE DISTRIBUTION		Quality and usefulness of the powder for additive manufacturing (AM) are strongly determined by the surface composition of the powder. In addition, taking into account harsh conditions during AM process, significant changes in the powder surface chemical composition are taking place, limiting powder recyclability. Hence, knowledge concerning amount of oxides, their composition and spatial distribution on the powder surface determines further powder recycling. This communication summarizes possibilities of qualitative and quantitative analysis of powder surface chemistry by surface-sensitive chemical analyses using XPS and HR SEM coupled with EDX.The effect of alloy composition, AM process applied and powder handling on the surface composition of the powder are addressed. Results indicate significant enrichment in the thermodynamically stable surface oxides in case of high-alloyed powder for both, EBM and LS processes. A generic model for the oxide distribution, depending on the alloy composition and powder surface degradation during AM manufacturing, is proposed.

Mixtures have been also characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Air-entraining agents, water retainer and superplasticizer additives have been used in order to improve the workability of mortars. The results show that the workability and mechanical strength decreases with increasing content of expanded polystyrene. Additives improve the workability and porosity, allowing manufacture mortars with high levels of recycled material that show mechanical properties suitable for use as masonry mortars, stucco and plaster.

So far, most studies of SLM have been focused on using virgin metal powders. There are few comprehensive studies on the microstructure and mechanical properties of SLM-produced parts using recycled powders, especially for maraging steels. In this study, we employ recycled steel powder (reused after 113 building cycles) in the SLM process to print multiple shaped components and systematically characterize the microstructure and mechanical properties (indentation, tensile, and Charpy testing). Our results show that maraging steel produced with recycled powder exhibit the nearly identical microstructure and mechanical properties (940 MPa yield strength, 1127 MPa ultimate tensile strength, 11 pct elongation, and 47.5 J room temperature impact fracture energy) to those produced using virgin powders. This study provides a useful generic guide towards using recycled metal powders in the SLM processing, promoting an economic solution to industrial productions.

J	Stolz, B; Mulhaupt, R				Stolz, Benjamin; Muelhaupt, Rolf			Cellular, Mineralized, and Programmable Cellulose Composites Fabricated by 3D Printing of Aqueous Pastes Derived from Paper Wastes and Microfibrillated Cellulose	MACROMOLECULAR MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						3D printing; additive manufacturing; cellulose; paper; recycling	NEWSPAPER; FIBERS; TISSUE; PERFORMANCE; POLYMERS; BIOINKS; IMPACT	Combining recycling of paper wastes (WPs) with extrusion-based additive manufacturing represents a sustainable route to cellular cellulose composites tailored for lightweight construction. Particularly, shear mixing of shredded WPs with an aqueous solution of a polymer binder like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) yields aqueous pastes suitable for 3D printing. As a shear thinning additive, both WP and microfibrillated cellulose account for enhanced shear thinning and dimensional stability. Opposite to the formation of dense WP/PVA composites by melt extrusion, 3D printing of aqueous pastes produces cellular cellulose/PVA composites exhibiting hierarchical pore architectures. In spite of low densities around 0.8 g cm(-3), high Young's modulus (2.0 GPa) and tensile strength (53 MPa) are achieved. Mechanical stability, water resistance, and even flame retardancy simultaneously improve by crosslinking with glyoxal and especially by mineralization. Multimaterial 3D printing combines the 3D dispensing of cellulose/PVA pastes with the simultaneous, staged, or subsequent spraying of aqueous water glass to enable mineralization of composite surface, bulk, and interlayers. Furthermore, the glyoxal-mediated crosslinking affords thermo- and moisture-responsive cellulose/PVA composites with programmable shape change induced either by heating at 100 degrees C or by exposure to moisture at 37 degrees C.

There is an increasing need to understand and improve its sustainability given the high profile of existing environmental challenges. This paper aims at developing a precise comparative model for the three major metal AM processes (including Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), Electron Beam Melting (EBM), and Direct Energy Deposition (DED)) with respect to environmental performance assessment with afuture goal of providing closed-loop feedbacks for design optimization with elevated sustainability. To improve the precision of previously reported models, new factors including embodied impacts of machine and recycled powder, operation patterns, system lifespan and batch size, are considered. A topologically optimized rocket bracket made of Ti6Al4V is used as an example to investigate the environmental performance of the three processes. The results showed that given the same design solution, the EBM had the lowest environmental impacts for low batch size, while the DED excelled at production efficiency.

This review considers both physical and chemical changes. It is proposed that by understanding these changes one can make better use of cellulosic fibers at various stages of their life cycles, achieving a broad range of paper performance characteristics. Some of the changes that occur as a result of recycling are inherent to the fibers themselves. Other changes may result from the presence of various contaminants associated with the fibers as a result of manufacturing processes and uses. The former category includes an expected loss of swelling ability and decreased wet-flexibility, especially after kraft fibers are dried. The latter category includes effects of inks, de-inking agents, stickies, and additives used during previous cycles of papermaking.

The solid wastes generated from the picture tube manufacturing process contain significant quantity of compounds of lead, nickel, cobolt, iron etc. The presence of toxic substances and their characteristic nature made these wastes hazardous and pose serious problems in their disposal resulting in major environmental concerns. In the present study an attempt has been made to develop a new cost effective process for immobilizing and recycling e-waste released from electronic industry in developing non-hazardous building material using additives and binders. Detoxification /immobilization of e-waste was achieved in making composite products using cement and sand as additives through solidification/stabilization process. Further strength and stability of solidified composite products was achieved through curing process. The quality and suitability of the S/S cured composite products were tested and assessed for their Engineering properties (compressive strength, water absorption, density), Toxicity leachate characteristics, Mineralogical studies, Morphological studies for their use in engineering applications, application as construction materials like bricks, blocks, aggregates and confirmed their environmental significance.				shaliniy2000@gmail.com; drchakradhar@ramky.com; aksphd2000@yahoo.com						16	0	0	0	6	TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD	STAFA-ZURICH	LAUBLSRUTISTR 24, CH-8717 STAFA-ZURICH, SWITZERLAND	1022-6680		978-3-03785-252-1	ADV MATER RES-SWITZ			2012	341-342		1-2				859	867		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.341-342.859			9	Engineering, Manufacturing; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Materials Science	BCA12	WOS:000309370100169					2022-01-29

Here, the open source Gigabot X is used to develop a new method to optimize FPF/FGF for recycled materials. Virgin polylactic acid(PLA) pellets and prints were analyzed and were then compared to four recycled polymers including the two most popular printing materials(PLA and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene(ABS)) as well as the two most common waste plastics(polyethylene terephthalate(PET) and polypropylene(PP)). The size characteristics of the various materials were quantified using digital image processing. Then, power and nozzle velocity matrices were used to optimize the print speed, and a print test was used to maximize the output for a two-temperature stage extruder for a given polymer feedstock. ASTM type 4 tensile tests were used to determine the mechanical properties of each plastic when they were printed with a particle drive extruder system and were compared with filament printing. The results showed that the Gigabot X can print materials 6.5 x to 13 x faster than conventional printers depending on the material, with no significant reduction in the mechanical properties. It was concluded that the Gigabot X and similar FPF/FGF printers can utilize a wide range of recycled polymer materials with minimal post processing.

Elements of computer monitors were used to prepare re-granulate, which in turn was used to manufacture a filament for fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing technology. Design/methodology/approach The geometry of test samples (i.e. dumbbell and bar) was obtained in accordance with the PN-EN standards. Samples made with the FFF technology were used to determine selected mechanical properties and to compare the results obtained with the properties of ABS re-granulate mould pieces made with the injection moulding technology. The GATE device manufactured by 3Novatica was used to make the prototypes with the FFF technology. Processing parameters were tested with the use of an Aflow extrusion plastometer manufactured by Zwick/Roell and other original testing facilities. Tests of mechanical properties were performed with a Z030 universal testing machine, a HIT 50P pendulum impact tester and a Z3106 hardness tester manufactured by Zwick/Roell. Findings The paper presents results of tests performed on a filament obtained from the ABS re-granulate and indicates characteristic processing properties of that material. The properties of the new secondary material were compared with the available original ABS materials that are commonly used in the additive technology of manufacturing geometrical objects. The study also presents selected results of tests of functional properties of ABS products made in the FFF technology. Originality/value The test results allowed authors to assess the possibility of a secondary application of used elements of electronic equipment housings in the FFF technology and to compare the strength properties of products obtained with similar products made with the standard injection moulding technology.

Reclaimed low density polyethylene (RLDPE), reclaimed low-density polyethylene with polymer additives consisting of 0.25% by weight of Cyasorb(R) UV-3346 Light Stabilizer; 0.25% by weight of Cyasorb(R) UV-531 Light Stabilizer: and 0.08% by weight of Cyanox(R) 2777 Antioxidant (RLDPE-PA), and virgin low-density polyethylene (LDPE) were pulverized to ultrafine powders ranging from 20 to 300 mu m, and utilized to impregnate a separated fiberglass tow. After initial experiments, two powder-impregnated composite tubes were manufactured for each thermoplastic material system. The composites were then tested for tensile (hoop) strength and compressive bending strength under the ASTM D2290-95 and C-ring tests, respectively. This study showed that while the RLDPE composite did not perform well, composite samples made with RLDPE and polymer additives (i.e., RLDPE-PA) performed better than RLDPE samples but not as well as composites made of virgin LDPE. The impregnation and consolidation steps in the manufacturing process were also effective for all three systems. The composite tubes exhibited very low void contents and high fiber volume fractions, while unmelted and unconsolidated thermoplastic powders were not present in the manufactured parts. The absence of fiber waviness and fiber migration through the thickness of the composite demonstrates that the online consolidation of powder-impregnated fibers was also effective. The collection of the separated powder-impregnated fibers prior to filament winding also seemed to be sufficient.

Wind energy industry; E. Mechanical recycling; E. Fused filament fabrication; B. Mechanical properties	COMPOSITES; POLYMERS; TECHNOLOGIES; DESIGN; FDM	The wind energy industry is one of the fastest-growing application sectors of composites, where reinforcement fibers are used in the manufacturing of light rotor blades. Considering the limited lifetime of turbine blades, a growing number of wind turbines will start to be decommissioned. Turbine blades are generally landfilled at their end-of-life, which highly impacts the environment. This paper proposes a systematic scheme combining mechanical recycling and 3D printing to recycle the valuable constituents of the scrap blades and reuse them in a Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process with the aim of improving the mechanical performance of 3D printed components. Mechanical grinding integrated with a double sieving mechanism is utilized to recover the reinforcement fibers. Tensile test specimens with 5 wt% fiber content are fabricated from the recycled fibers and plastic pellets and their mechanical properties as well as internal microstructure are investigated. The results demonstrate an improvement of 16% and 10% in the elastic modulus and ultimate strength of the reinforced composite filament as compared to the commercially available pure PLA filament. As well, a Young's modulus of 3.35 GPa was observed for the FFF fabricated samples, which is an 8% increase relative to pure PLA samples.

The objective of this research was to determine some physical and mechanical parameters of composite made with Pinus taeda and elliottii wood flour (WF) and recycled polypropylene (PP), without the use of compatibilizers or additives. The composites were separated into four traits, namely 100% PP, 90% PP with 10%, WF 80% PP with 20% WF and 70 % PP with 30% WF. The characterization of the composite followed the standards ASTM D-638-10, ASTM D256-00, ASTM D570 -98, ASTM D1238 -10 and ASTM G 155-05, it was also employed the surface analysis by scanning electron microscopy. The dimensional stability tests showed satisfactory results. Even the composite with a higher percentage of wood flour (30%) had a flow index of 10 MFI, considered compatible with that observed for PP (polypropylene) virgin by standard ASTM D 1238-10. The inclusion of wood flour (FM) afforded composites with good mechanical characteristics which can be applied in manufacture of different materials, specifically employed outdoors.

Rafael			Additive Manufacturing with Liquid Latex and Recycled End-of-Life Rubber	3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						3D printing; rubber; latex; recycling; multimaterial printing; drop-on-demand	INKJET; LASER	Elastomers and rubber are common industrial materials used for test objects, supporting parts, and many other commercial products. The industrial processing of these materials is currently dominated by injection molding, which reduces manufacturing costs and speeds up production. However, this manufacturing method does not permit personalization or customization and lacks the versatility of other techniques such as three-dimensional printing. Understandably, there has been a move toward additive manufacturing (AM) with elastomers. This work proposes a new approach to AM with liquid latex, using a drop-on-demand (DoD) based inkjet to fabricate latex patterns. The printhead actuator benefits from a higher material compatibility compared to conventional inkjet/extrusion-based printers, allowing the jetting of viscous fluids, as well as liquids with high solid loading. The setup allows printing with viscous liquid latex of a high solid content (60 wt. %). The process is controllable and reliable, making the printing of patterns possible. In addition, we explore printing with micronized rubber powder (MRP) made from end-of-life tires, to test solid-particle loading compatibility and as a novel method for rubber recycling. In this study, we demonstrate that large-scale DoD inkjet printing is capable of handling solid particle loadings of up to 10wt. % in addition to the high solid content liquid latex. Moreover, multilayer objects were created from pure liquid latex, as well as from MRP/latex suspensions. Material characterization indicates that the stiffness of cured latex is not altered by the addition of MRP, but reduces the maximum elongation length from 750% to 430%. The results highlight the ability to print with both high particle loading and large particles.

Considering the high environmental impact that the production of asphalt mixtures for road pavements entails, in terms of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, these operations must follow the global transition towards more sustainable development practices. In response to this, previous research has been focused on the development of manufacturing low temper-ature asphalt mixtures and the use of recycled modifiers such as tire crumb rubber to improve their durability. However, the use of high dosages of the latter reduces mixture workability, thus requiring high manufacturing temperatures to reduce the viscosity of the binder, and therefore limiting the advancement towards more sustainable mixtures. In this regard, further knowledge is needed on this topic to promote the combination of such techniques to maximise their advantages. This study aims to check the viability of producing asphalt mixtures with high crumb rubber contents at reduced temperatures, testing their workability, stiffness, cohesion, resistance to permanent deformations and resistance to moisture damage. Results show that it is possible to manufacture viable, warm, rubberised asphalt mixtures at 150 degrees C using a high penetration bitumen and reduce this temperature to 130 degrees C (45 degrees C less than conventional rubberised asphalt mixtures) by including warm additives, without compromising their mechanical performance.

The objective of this paper is to contribute to the structure of the scientific field residing in the intersection of AM and Circular Economy (CE), by determining the status of its current state-of-the-art, proposing an initial typology in an attempt to contribute to the existing efforts of structuring this rather novice research area and pinpointing research gaps where more focus should be put, and highlighting areas with a significant potential for added-value future research. To that end, a sample of 206 papers, published from 2014 to 2020, was retrieved from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. After studying and critically evaluating their content in full, contributions were classified into six thematic categories, providing a first typology of the current literature, followed by a detailed section highlighting and taxonomizing existing review studies. Next, contributions of the three categories of interest are discussed followed by a critical evaluation of the study's contribution, inherent limitations and future research potential.

At the end-of-life of the product, many polymeric materials are recycled and the additives they contain, such as flame retardants (FRs) and plasticizers, are transferred to the newly manufactured goods. We have investigated the occurrence and profiles of FRs, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and phosphate FR (PFRs) and of plasticisers, such as phthalate esters, in 106 toys samples. Low levels and detection frequencies of components of the technical Penta-BDE and Deca-BDE mixtures were found, with BDE 209 being the dominant PBDE in all samples (maximum value was 0.14 mg/g or 0.014%). The levels of PFRs and phthalates were up to 10,000 times higher than those of the PBDEs, with triphenyl phosphate and diethylhexyl phthalate being the major representatives of these classes. Maximum values were 1.3 and 6.9%, respectively. The detection frequencies were up to 50% for PFRs and 98% for phthalates. All but one of the toys produced after the REACH regulation went into force complied with its provisions. The samples were grouped according to relevant selection criteria to assess the risk for children of different age groups. Using models in the literature, exposure to these chemicals was tentatively assessed. It is clear that at the levels found in the investigated toys, these additives do not contribute to the intended characteristics of the materials, but in some cases may pose a health hazard to the children. Most likely, recycled materials are an important source of these additives in toys and therefore, their (re)use in products for children should be subject to stricter restrictions.

The primary issue after price is quality. This has been addressed primarily from the food safety perspective and not from the quality as it relates to flavor and taste. It is generally accepted, that if quality requirements are satisfied, then the material safety data will also meet the requirements. This paper is directed toward the technology required to produce recycled polymers that met the safety and quality assurance needed to satisfy the consumer product companies. We will be discussing the specific areas of: 1) Supply feedstock continuity and handling 2) Process Instrumentation and Control Strategy 3) Migration testing for Indirect Food Additives The basic premise of the technology is to provide Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) with the ability to have systems in place controlling the critical parameters. These will be addressed in the following area: 1) Statistical Automatic Sampling 2) Detection, Measurement and Control of Process and Quality 3) Recycling Process Control (SPC/ISO 9000) 4) Food Container Manufacturing Various known contaminates required by both Government and Industry testing, need to be correlated to ''Real World Data'' for both safety and quality of the food products. We will present the technology currently produced by the recycling industry in Automatic Sortation, Cleaning Processes, Quality Assurance from Lot to Lot.

Special emphasis is placed on the development of materials that would be cheaper, from natural sources, without releases of harmful substances during the manufacturing process and usage, with the possibility of using waste materials and recycling after service life. Wood or wood residues are one of the potential raw materials that could be used for 3D printing in combination with natural and synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that with the development of additive technologies, the use of wood-plastic composites will also expand to the area of structural elements, for example, in the construction of prefabricated houses. The fire behaviour of 3D printed wood/PLA specimens was determined according to ASTM E 2058 standard and microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC) with ASTM 7309-13.

A giant amount of waste, such as: electronics/electrical items, manufacturing scrap, discarded constructional materials, polymers from daily needs, etc., is being generated day-by-day, whereas its treatment is lagging. The term zero waste (ZW) is continuously encouraging both producers and consumers to adopt sustainable approaches in order to reduce their expenditures as well as to help in making a better world. In the past, researchers have highlighted numerous techniques to tackle physical waste, however the chemicals which are normally generated from this waste is more critical and limitedly reported. Zero Waste Manufacturing (ZWM) is believed as a roadmap for future of manufacturing by which the burning issue of "Waste" can be tackled. However, ZWM can be supported with recycling and reusability of the produced wastes in another manufacturing process, use of optimization tools and sustainable manufacturing theories, development of precision manufacturing systems, etc. This review article is taken up to discuss various recent sustainable manufacturing ideas applied in the prominent sectors with an aim to either re-cycle/re-use the discarded ones or to produce a fresh part in eco-friendly manners. Special attention is paid to the current trends in machining and a brief case study of sustainable manufacturing of aerospace industry has also been discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The tested samples connect pore formation to part orientation, part location and the use of recycled powder. These data serve as the basis for development of a Random Forest Network machine learning (ML) model capable of two-way modeling of process-property and process-structure relationships. These results show how common procedural steps in the setup and execution of L-PBF effect porosity, particularly the formation of keyhole and lack of fusion (LOF) defects, and how data collection, processing, and validation can expose even subtle connections between input features and output parameters using a general ML framework.

The peak of the heat release rate was 12% to 25% lower compared to references produced from pure polyethylene- and polypropylene-based composites. The total heat capacity and mass loss rate were also smaller for recycled material compared to the references. The stability of the composites was improved due to the presence of various thermally stable compounds, eg, traces of fire retardants, pigments, and other additives and impurities that can be present in recycled material. Incorporation of carbon black into the secondary materials did not reduce the peak of the heat release rate, but the total heat capacity and mass loss rate decreased further.

Here, metal exposure in an AM facility with large-scale metallic component production was investigated during two consecutive years with preventive actions in between. Methods: Gravimetric analyzes measured airborne particle concentrations, and filters were analyzed for metal content. In addition, concentrations of airborne particles <300 nm were investigated. Particles from recycled powder were characterized. Biomonitoring of urine and dermal contamination among AM operators, office personnel, and welders was performed. Results: Total and inhalable dust levels were almost all below occupational exposure limits, but inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry showed that AM operators had a significant increase in cobalt exposure compared with welders. Airborne particle concentrations (<300 nm) showed transient peaks in the AM facility but were lower than those of the welding facility. Particle characterization of recycled powder showed fragmentation and condensates enriched in volatile metals. Biomonitoring showed a nonsignificant increase in the level of metals in urine in AM operators. Dermal cobalt and a trend for increasing urine metals during Workweek Year 1, but not in Year 2, indicated reduced exposure after preventive actions. Conclusion: Gravimetric analyses showed low total and inhalable dust exposure in AM operators. However, transient emission of smaller particles constitutes exposure risks. Preventive actions implemented by the company reduced the workers' metal exposure despite unchanged emissions of particles, indicating a need for careful design and regulation of the AM environments. It also emphasizes the need for relevant exposure markers and biomonitoring of health risks. (C) 2019 Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

J	Bojestig, E; Cao, Y; Nyborg, L				Bojestig, Eric; Cao, Yu; Nyborg, Lars			Surface chemical analysis of copper powder used in additive manufacturing	SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS			English	Article						additive manufacturing (AM); copper oxide; copper powder; surface chemistry; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)	SELECTIVE LASER; REUSE	Additive manufacturing (AM) has during years gained significant interest owing to its endless component design possibilities. One of the most popular AM techniques is laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), which selectively melts metal powder layer-by-layer in a chamber with protective argon atmosphere. This technique is attractive for realizing Cu-based products in which the high electrical conductivity of Cu is combined with component design possibilities. The successful use of Cu powder not only poses challenges owing to the high reflectivity and thermal conductivity of Cu but also involves the important concern of controlling the powder surface chemistry since the powder surface constitutes the main source of oxygen. It is of crucial importance to control the oxygen level in order to maintain good electrical conductivity and brazing ability of the AM-fabricated Cu-part. In LPBF, fine spherical powder with size of 10-60 mu m is used, providing significant specific surface area, and this powder is also usually recycled several times, and hence, the role of powder surface chemistry is evident. Two kinds of copper powder with purities 99.70 and 99.95 wt% were analysed in both virgin and in used conditions after numerous printing cycles using LPBF. The powder was analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A clear difference between the two powder grades in terms of surface chemistry was observed. The oxide thickness and bulk oxygen content increased for both powder grades after recycling. The surface oxides under different conditions are identified and the effect of powder purity on the oxide formed is discussed.

It is well known that surface roughness is influenced by the applied processing parameters and correlates with porosity. In terms of reactive materials like Ti-6Al-4V, also the powder recycling grade and especially the residual oxygen content within the processing atmosphere play important roles regarding process stability, reproducibility and part properties. Therefore, this study investigated the influence of the residual oxygen content on porosity and surface roughness for virgin as well as recycled powder by employing DoE techniques. Within the examined range, unlike for the roughness, no significant influence of residual oxygen content and powder constitution on porosity could be detected. It could be shown that the reproducibility of relative density mainly depends on the processing parameter combination. Furthermore, powder recycling led to higher top and side surface roughness and a dependence of surface texture on processing parameters could be demonstrated.

For that reason the purpose of this study was to manufacture sustainable bricks, based on three types of wastes generated in the building industry: wood cutting residues, wastes from the excavation process (From Coapa and Cuautlancingo, Puebla, Mexico) and recycled aggregates. Water was added as kneading material, and Opuntia ficus-indica (mucilage) was supplemented as natural additive to improve the workability of the mixtures. Conventional firing process was substituted by drying in a solar drying chamber. Nine mixtures were prepared using 62% excavation wastes, 4% wood cutting residues and 11%, 17% and 34% recycled aggregates. These mixtures were classified in two groups depending on their granulometry: the first one denominated cementitious recycled aggregates only having granulometry from 25.4 mm, 9.52 mm to 6.35 mm to fines and the second group denominated all in one recycled aggregates having granulometry of 6.35 mm to fines. The quality of the sustainable bricks was evaluated according to compressive strength and water absorption parameters. The results of nine mixtures showed that the reconstruction-bricks manufactured with the mixture seven consisting of 9.52 mm and 6.35 mm construction residues (all in one) fines presented the highest strength values, lowest maximum initial absorption (4 g/min) compared to the norm NMX-C-037-ONNCCE-2013 which establishes that the maximum limit for walls exposed to the outside is 5 g/min. Using a solar desiccator made from construction residues, the bricks were dried in 11 days, the maximum temperature was 76 degrees C and the maximum solar radiation captured was 733.4 W/m(2).

The use of these wastes in other industrial areas as a raw material or raw material additive is an important research area, at the present time. By this usage, disposal cost reduction and landfill usage period increments will be provided. In this study, firing process stack emissions are investigated when using automotive industry treatment sludge as an additive to brick raw material. Chemical treatment sludge, which is categorized as non-hazardous. according to the General Fundamentals Relating to Waste Management Regulation (GFRWMR) Appendix-3-B, does not adversely affect the product quality, with additive rates of 5% and 10 to raw material, according to experimental studies on field-scale experimental brick production. During the firing process, stack gas emissions were sampled and measured according to the Industry Originated Air Pollution Control Regulation (IOAPCR), and the Hazardous Waste Control Regulation (HWCR). According to the measurement results, chemical treatment sludge as an additive to the raw material was determined as a useful recycling option; however, it should be monitored according to variable process conditions.

By observing these solutions, the recycling system from the waste collection and separation system of the long-term disappearing of polymer waste to the additive manufacturing design stage has been indicated. Waste collection and separation systems have been reviewed and systems to be used effectively in the systematic way have been exemplified. Among four different separating systems which are with rotating, rail and fixed containers, fixed container four-sorting waste separation systems were chosen and developed as a mechatronic system design. The mechatronic system design is very prominent in order to create efficient and economical mechanisms in fixed-container four-sorting waste separation collection system (FCWS) applications. In addition, physical mechatronic system design (MSD), mechanical design, material selection, electrical electronic design sub-heading and cost analysis were made.

In addition to the technological progress of printing systems, the development of functional and low environmental impact printable mixtures is one of the current challenges of digital fabrication in building and architectural fields. This paper proposes a preliminary physical-mechanical analysis on environmentally friendly mortars, compatible with the extrusion-based printing process, made up of recycling rubber aggregates deriving from end-of-life tires. In this study, two groups of rubber particle samples (0-1 mm rubber powder and 2-4 mm rubber granules) were used to partially/totally replace the mineral fraction of the reference printable mixture. Four tire rubber powder-granules proportions were investigated and control mortar (100% sand) was also prepared to compare its properties with those of the rubber-cement samples in terms of printability properties, mechanical strength, ductility, and structural isotropy. Based on the experimental results, the rubber aggregates increase the mixture fluidity, promoting better inter-layer adhesion than the neat mix. This leads to greater mechanical isotropy. As already investigated in other research works on Rubber-Concrete technology, the addition of rubber particles increases the ductility of the material but reduces its mechanical strength. However, by correctly balancing the fine and coarse rubber fraction, promising physical-mechanical performances were demonstrated.

However, additive manufacturing of HDPE by means of fused deposition modeling (FDM) also known as fused filament fabrication (FFF) has been problematic owing to its massive shrinkage, voiding and warpage problems accompanied by its poor adhesion to common build plates and to extruded HDPE strands. Herein we overcome these problems and improve Young's modulus, tensile strength and surface quality of 3D printed HDPE by varying 3D printing parameters like temperature and diameter of the nozzle, extrusion rate, build plate temperature, and build plate material. Both nozzle diameter and printing speed affect surface quality but do not impair mechanical properties. Particularly, an extrusion rate gradient prevents void formation. For the first time additive manufactured HDPE and injection-molded HDPE exhibit similar mechanical properties with exception of elongation at break. Excellent fusion of the extruded polymer strands and the absence of anisotropy are achieved, as verified by microscopic imaging and measuring the tensile strength parallel and perpendicular to the 3D printing direction.

The manufacturing of Portland cement is a highly energy-intensive process, recycling utilization of many industrial by-products are available in large quantities that can be used to replace Portland cement in concrete, called as supplementary cementitious materials or mineral additives. Workability, mechanical properties and durability of concrete can be greatly improved with the advanced mineral admixtures. The workability and mechanical properties of steel slag concrete with different types of steel slag and different dosage of admixtures are studied. The experimental results showed the effect of steel slag powder on concrete performance. When compound mineral admixtures with steel slag powder and blast-furnace slag powder are mixed into concrete, the performance of concrete can be improved further due to the synergistic effect and mutual activation.

This implies the need for additive manufacturing to focus on the development and use of low-impact materials that, after product use, can be reconstituted to their original properties in terms of printability and functionality. We therefore investigated reprintable materials, made from bio-based resources. In order to equally consider material properties and recovery during development, we took a design approach to material development. In this way, the full material and product life cycle was studied, including multiple recovery steps. We applied this method to the development of a reprintable bio-based composite material for extrusion paste printing. This material is derived from natural and abundant resources, i.e., ground mussel shells and alginate. The alginate in the printing paste is ionically cross-linked after printing to create a water-resistant material. This reaction can be reversed to retain a printable paste. We studied paste composition, printability and material properties and 3D printed a design prototype. Alginate as a binder shows good printing and reprinting behaviour, as well as promising material properties. It thus demonstrates the concept of reprintable materials.

The powder/gas mixture flew through a heat exchange channel mounted under the sheet substrate, and it was then heated by heat exchange. The temperature, deformation, microstructure, and the microhardness were investigated under the natural cooling, water forced cooling, and powder/gas mixture cooling conditions. The thermal power absorbed by the powder/gas mixture is 0.4% of the laser power and is much less than that of water (similar to 36%), but the recycled laser energy preheated the powder and increased the thickness of the cladding layer. The deformation under the powder/gas mixture cooling condition lies between the natural cooling and the water cooling conditions. The results indicated that the cooling medium significantly affected the thermal history of thin plate substrate laser cladding and the property of cladding layer.

This study presents water-based robotic fabrication as a design approach and enabling technology for AM of biodegradable hydrogel composites. Our research focuses on the combination of expanding the dimensions of the fabrication envelope, developing structural materials for additive deposition, incorporating material-property gradients, and manufacturing architectural-scale biodegradable systems. This work presents a robotically controlled AM system to produce biodegradable composite objects combining natural hydrogels, such as chitosan and sodium alginate, with other organic aggregates. It demonstrates the approach by designing, building, and evaluating the mechanics and controls of a multichamber extrusion system. Finally, it provides evidence of large-scale composite objects fabricated by our technology that display graded properties and feature sizes ranging from micro-to macroscale. Fabricated objects may be chemically stabilized or dissolved in water and recycled within minutes. Applications include the fabrication of fully recyclable products or temporary architectural components such as tent structures with graded mechanical and optical properties. Proposed applications demonstrate environmental capabilities such as water-storing structures, hydration-induced shape forming, and product disintegration over time.

In particular, powder bed processes offer a high degree of design flexibility while enabling weight reduction due to topological optimisation. The quality and properties of the parts are strongly dependent on the powder quality which, in turn, is influenced by handling and storage of the powder. For this reasons an undefined contamination of atomised powder materials by oxygen and hydrogen has to be avoided. Aluminium-silicon powder was aged under atmosphere of different moistures and temperatures for defined duration. The effect of these environments as well as the effect of vacuum drying on the flowability was investigated. The morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscope. The chemistry including oxygen content of the powder was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and hot fusion analysis.

Effective and efficient methods must be developed to correctly dispose and recycle the wastes produced. It is also necessary to reduce the non-renewable resources used and lower the impact on our environment. In 2017, over 13.5 million square meters of tiles were produced globally, and the demand for ceramic tiles has escalated along with social development. There has been an increasing incentive to recycle waste materials in ceramic tiles due to the high heterogeneity of the raw materials, and the matrix for creating ceramics being flexibly interchangeable. The objective of this paper is to review and discuss the various recycling options of waste materials in the production of ceramic tiles. Past experimentation includes the addition of glass, coal ash, municipal solid waste ash, sewage sludge, and mining and ore wastes in ceramic tiles. They were used as an additive or substitute for the key components of the ceramic tiles. The results show a general enhancement to the physical and mechanical properties of the tiles with minor adverse effects on the aesthetics. Furthermore, when recycled with toxic wastes, the heavy metals were found to be immobilised during the firing process of the tiles. Therefore, the addition of wastes in tiles offers a sustainable solution to a growing pollution problem, in addition to decreasing the consumption of natural resources utilised in the manufacturing of tiles. However, further research and developments are essential.

Athary			Devulcanization and Recycling of Waste Automotive EPDM Rubber Powder by Using Shearing Action and Chemical Additive	PROGRESS IN RUBBER PLASTICS AND RECYCLING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TIRE; AGENT; GRT	In automotive applications, ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) is used to manufacture various components and therefore recycling scrap rubber is a major issue. The primary aim of this study was to develop a new method for devulcanizing waste automotive EPDM rubber powder by using shearing action and chemical additive and recycle the devulcanized powder A semi-industrial twin screw extruder with a shearing action and reactor along with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole-disulfide (MBTS) chemical were used to devulcanize the waste powder at two different feed screw speeds and main rotor speeds at a constant temperature of 220 degrees C. To recycle the devulcanized powder, different amounts of the devulcanized powder were mixed with a commercial EPDM-based automotive rubber strips compound to produce blends. The blends, commercial compound and devulcanized powder were cured with a semi-efficient (SEV) vulcanization system and their viscosity cure and mechanical properties measured. For the blends, the Mooney viscosity was unchanged with 40 wt%, crosslink density with 20 wt%, tensile strength and elongation at break with 10 wt%, and compression set with 20 wt% of the devulcanized powder. Interestingly the hardness benefitted from 50 wt% of the devulcanized powder in the blends. The scorch and optimum cure times shortened and the cure rate index rose when the loading of the devulcanized powder in the blends was raised. This new method offered a major new route for devulcanizing and recycling the waste powder.	[Movahed, S. Ostad; Karbalaee, S.; Far, S.

In this study, the microstructure and mechanical properties of a nickel-based superalloy fabricated by laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) using recycled powders were investigated. Re-melted powder surfaces, satellite particles, and deformed powders were found in the recycled powders, combined with a high-oxygen-content surface layer. The increasing oxygen content led to the formation of high-density oxide inclusions; moreover, printing-induced cracks widely occurred and mainly formed along the grain boundaries in the as-built LPBF nickel-based superalloys fabricated using recycled powders. A little change in the Si or Mn content did not increase the hot cracking susceptibility (HCS) of the printed parts. The changing aspect ratio and the surface damage of the recycled powders might contribute to increasing the crack density. Moreover, the configuration of cracks in the as-built parts led to anisotropic mechanical properties, mainly resulting in extremely low ductility vertical to the building direction, and the cracks mainly propagated along the cellular boundary owing to the existence of a brittle precipitation phase.

Therefore, glass materials are often extracted and recycled for other applications. The building and construction (B&C) field present an attractive application for recycled glass as replacement of fine aggregates in cementitious materials, the second most consumed material in the world after water. With the growth in interest towards 3D printing for the B&C field in recent years, much research has been conducted with respect to 3D cementitious material printing (3DCMP). 3DCMP has gained its stand in the B&C field as it does not require any formwork and human intervention and permits designing for structural optimization. Hence, with the accompanying advantages of both 3DCMP and the need for recycling glass waste, this study aims to replace the fine aggregates of the cementitious material by the processed recycled glass to be used for 3D printing. This paper studies the gradation of the recycled glass aggregates in the 3D printable cementitious material. Three different gradations were designed using the different particle size of recycled glass materials supplied and investigated using the same binder mix design. For each gradation, the fresh and hardened properties were investigated. Printing investigations were also conducted on the studied recycled glass gradations.

J	Nassar, NT				Nassar, Nedal T.			Shifts and trends in the global anthropogenic stocks and flows of tantalum	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Conflict minerals; Recycling; Material flow analysis; Critical metals; Tantalum	LIFE-CYCLE; BARRIERS; TUNGSTEN; GALLIUM; METALS; INDIUM	The supply and demand of tantalum has undergone a number of significant shifts over the past few decades. The purpose of this work is to quantify how these shifts have affected tantalum's global material cycle. A global stocks and flows model for tantalum has thus been developed for the years 1970-2015. The results indicate that the overall quantity of tantalum prompt scrap generated during manufacturing has increased notably due to tantalum's increased use as an alloy additive and sputtering target. In contrast, the amount of tantalum contained in recycled obsolete scrap, mainly in the form of used carbides, is estimated to have remained relatively constant since the late-1980s. Moreover, tantalum's overall end-of-life recycling rate (EoL-RR) seems to have declined from a high of 22-25% in the 1990s to approximately 18% today. This decline is also attributable to the shift in tantaluin's use from carbides to sputtering targets and chemicals that, along with tantalum's use in capacitors, have not been recycled at the end-of-life (EoL) in significant quantities. The results also indicate that 21-25% of tantalum produced since 1970 is still in use today, with the remainder having been lost during processing, manufacturing, use, or at the EoL. However, a portion of the EoL "discards" may actually still be retained by the end-user as "hibernating" stocks that could potentially be recycled if the economic, technical, and behavioral challenges of recycling obsolete electronics are overcome.

The raw materials were two commercial degrees of recycled post-consumer waste, i.e., rPP and rPET-O. Sheets were manufactured by a semi-industrial extrusion-calendering process. The mechanical and fracture behaviours of manufactured sheets were analyzed via tensile tests and the essential work of fracture approach. SEM micrographics of cryofractured sheets revelated the development of in situ rPP/rPET-O microfibrillar composites when 30 wt.% of rPET-O was added. It was observed that the yield stress was not affected with the addition of rPET-O. However, the microfibrillar structure increased the Young's modulus by more than a third compared with rPP, fulfilling the longitudinal value predicted by the additive rule of mixtures. Regarding the EWF analysis, the resistance to crack initiation was highly influenced by the resistance to its propagation owing to morphology-related instabilities during tearing. To analyze the initiation stage, a partition energy method was successfully applied by splitting the total work of fracture into two specific energetic contributions, namely initiation and propagation. The results revelated that the specific essential initiation-related work of fracture was mainly affected by rPET-O phase. Remarkably, its value was significantly improved by a factor of three with the microfibrillar structure of rPET-O phase. The results allowed the exploration of the potential ability of manufacturing in situ MFCs without a "precursor" morphology, providing an economical way to promote the recycling rate of PET-O, as this material is being discarded from current recycling processes.

Three different recycled thermoplastics, namely acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) (with different Young's modulus, glass transition temperature, rheological properties), have been selected (as a case study) for multi-material AM. The functional prototypes have been printed on fused deposition modelling (FDM) setup as tensile specimens (as per ASTM D638 type-IV standard) with different combinations of top, middle, and bottom layers (of ABS/PLA/HIPS), at different printing speed and infill percentage density. The specimens were subjected to thermal (glass transition temperature and heat capacity) and mechanical testing (peak load, peak strength, peak elongation, percentage elongation at peak, and Young's modulus) to ascertain their suitability in load-bearing structures, and the fabrication of functional prototypes of mechanical meta-materials. The results have been supported by photomicrographs to observe the microstructure of the analyzed multi-materials.

In this research, only one aggregate gradation with NMAS of 19 mm, one virgin binder (AC 60-70), and one RAP material source at six levels of content (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50%) have been selected to prepare the stone matrix asphalt (SMA) mixtures. Furthermore, two warm mix asphalt additives including zycotherm and sasobit have been used in manufacturing (SMA) samples to carry out dynamic creep test in two levels of stress rate (300 kPa and 650 kpa), and Topcel additive fibers have been used to prevent draindown of these types of asphalt mixtures. Then, computerized programming has been developed to obtain regression coefficient parameters of the equations in three-stage models by Matlab software. Also, the correlations have been found between flow number achieved by the three-stage model and minimum rate of total permanent deformation. The result has indicated that there are good correlations between the two methods. Also, the results of the dynamic creep test to measure the flow number in 650 kPa stress level showed that by adding RAP to control SMA specimen, the FN content increases. Moreover by adding Zycotherm to samples manufactured by SMA specimen containing the RAP, the FN content increases by increasing RAP up to 40%. Also by adding sasobit to samples manufactured by SMA specimen containing the RAP and Zycotherm, the FN content increases by increasing RAP up to 30%. The highest amount of flow number (FN) relates to a specimen containing both zycotherm and sasobit and 30% RAP. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Smythe, SA; Thomas, B; Jackson, M				Smythe, Sarah A.; Thomas, Ben M.; Jackson, Martin			Recycling of Titanium Alloy Powders and Swarf through Continuous Extrusion (Conform(TM)) into Affordable Wire for Additive Manufacturing	METALS			English	Article						solid-state processing; wiredrawing; direct energy deposition; waste recycling	METAL POWDERS; ECAP	Over the last 20 years, there has been growing research and development investment to exploit the benefits of wire deposition additive manufacturing (AM) for the production of near-net shape components in aircraft and space applications. The wire feedstock for these processes is a significant part of the overall process costs, especially for high-value materials such as alloyed titanium. Powders for powder-based AM have tight specifications regarding size and morphology, resulting in a significant amount of waste during the powder production. In the aerospace sector, up to 95% of forged billet can be machined away, and with increasing aircraft orders, stockpiles of such machining swarf are increasing. In this study, the continuous extrusion process-Conform(TM)-was employed to consolidate waste titanium alloy feedstocks in the forms of gas atomised powder and machining swarf into wire. Samples of wire were further cold-drawn down to 40% reduction, using conventional wiredrawing equipment. As close to 100% of the waste powder can be converted to wire by using the Conform(TM)process. This technology offers an attractive addition to the circular economy for manufacturers and, with further development, could be an important addition as industries move toward more sustainable supply chains.

Food and packaging industry uses the most, the life cycle of which becomes short, they become waste very quick. Also included are light weight bottles of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Large amounts of waste can be handled with multiple options. The worst is their dumping on dump sites, as these materials do not compost. Their thermal recycling is more favorable due to their high calorific value, but a real cycle can only be achieved by their physical recycling. However, during the multiple re-purposing, PET's mechanical and processing properties are reduced. In our research, chemical foaming has been investigated, resulting in a smaller weight, better specific property, and fully reusable product. During our investigations, the structure and mechanical properties of recycled PET (rPET) specimens manufactured with different composition, chain and foam additives were analyzed.	[Szabo, V.

This paper reports progress in the use of recycled wood aggregate for concrete block. The project goal was to use standard concrete block manufacturing procedures to produce a lightweight block meeting the requirements of ASTM C129 for non-loadbearing concrete masonry. Trial cylinders were made in a laboratory simulation of block plant processes to evaluate admixtures and wood treatments, then promising mixes were used to make several batches of blocks in a commercial plant. Cylinders and blocks were tested for compressive strength, and the blocks were subjected to wet-dry cycling. Results indicate that weight, strength, and durability targets were met. Questions remain regarding the economic performance of the product, and further study is required to evaluate the effect of curing blocks in the uncontrolled exterior conditions typical of the block industry.

Potential of distributed recycling from hybrid manufacturing of 3-D printing and injection molding of stamp sand and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate waste composite	SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Recycling; Stamp sand; Acrylonitrile styrene acrylate; Composite; Additive manufacturing	BUTADIENE-STYRENE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYMER; FILAMENT; COPPER; COMPONENTS; EFFICIENCY; OUTDOOR; AREA	In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, over 500 million tons of copper rich rock were removed from mines and treated in chemical baths to extract copper. Toxic substances have been seeping into the watersheds from the resultant waste stamp sands. Recent work on developing a circular economy using recycled plastic for distributed manufacturing technologies has proven promising, and this study investigates the potential to use this approach to form stamp sand and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA) composites. Specifically, this study found the maximum amount of stamp sand that was able to be added to waste ASA by mass with a single auger recyclebot system for compounding was below 40%. The mechanical properties of the composite were evaluated up to 40%, and the addition of stamp sand reduced the material's ultimate tensile strength by about half compared to the strength of raw recycled ASA, regardless of the percent stamp sand in the composite. However, this strength reduction plateaus and the tensile strength of the ASA and stamp sand composites can be compared favorably with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) at any level. This makes waste ASAstamp sand composites potential replacements for outdoor applications of ABS as well as some current ASA applications. These results are promising and call for future work to evaluate the technical, economic and environmental potential for waste ASA stamp sand composites. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The panels made with this technology are more ecological than the traditional ones, made with shavings and fibers of wood, because they incorporate plastic wastes as raw material instead of natural resources. Because of the likely deterioration of the panel when exposed to UV-Radiation in outdoor application, they are recommended to inside buildings as coating walls and the manufacture of furniture, whereby they have to comply with the class RE-3 low flame propagation material, according to IRAM 11910-3:1994, NBR 9442: 1986 and ASTM E 162: 1994 Norms. Several fire retardant treatments were tested, and their influence on the flexural resistance of the panels. By other hand, a comparative study of costs was performed between the panels commercially available, and the panels developed with this technology. The use of HT-E free of halogens is proposed, which obtains a classification RE-3 and not significantly alter the flexural resistance of the panels.

In particular, both as-received and mechanically lapped samples were studied. The results obtained have shown that the microstructure of the DMLS samples is of martensitic type, due to the heat treatment during the formation process, while the diffractometric tests showed mainly the presence of the a phase. The electrochemical characteristics of the samples vary significantly if virgin or recycled powders are used. Finally, it was found that even the surface finish of the samples obtained for DMLS has a profound influence on the electrochemical response of the material.

A complete cycle from cellulose to the printed object has been performed. The printed PEF objects created in the present study show higher chemical resistance than objects printed with commonly available materials (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PETG)). The studied PEF polymer has shown key advantages for 3D printing: optimal adhesion, thermoplasticity, lack of delamination and low heat shrinkage. The high thermal stability of PEF and relatively low temperature that is necessary for extrusion are optimal for recycling printed objects and minimizing waste. Several successive cycles of 3D printing and recycling were successfully shown. The suggested approach for extending additive manufacturing to carbon-neutral materials opens a new direction in the field of sustainable development.

This study intended to evaluate the effectiveness of using a By-product Recycled mill Scale (BRS) in improving the geotechnical properties of high-plastic subgrade soil. The efficacy of the BRS was judged by the improvement in the consistency limits, compaction, free swell, Unconfined Compression Strength (UCS), and the California bearing ratio (CBR). Results showed that BRS additives reduced the plasticity index and the free swell, increased the UCS, the maximum dry density, and the CBR values. Cementitious materials (lime and cement) were added to the subgrade soil that was stabilised with 20% BRS for pavement's subbase applications. Resilient modulus (M-R) was performed using Repeated Load Triaxial (RLT) device to evaluate the resilient response of laboratory-moulded stabilised specimens under cyclic loading. The results showed that the cement-BRS-stabilised soil specimens showed the highest improvement. As a conclusion, BRS showed a positive effect on the geotechnical properties of the soil and it can be used as an additive to improve the geotechnical properties of the subgrade soil and thence solve the BRS disposal problem.

The synthesis of the monomer was carried out following a sustainable process, without any solvent and purification. The novel polybenzoxazine can be recycled, reshaped and (re)processed, thanks to a fast relaxation process (18 seconds at 120 degrees C) and low activation energy (64.5 kJ mol(-1)). Furthermore, the benzoxazine vitrimer shows significant and healable adhesive properties over short times and at low temperatures. These features support it also being considered in additive manufacturing applications, with the possibility of applying 3D printing technology, extending its application to many fields of materials.

However, the mechanical suitability aspect in terms of material wear has not received much attention yet and needs rigorous assessment. This study investigates the wear anisotropy in an AlSi10Mg alloy sample fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) technique. Different scanning strategies encompassing the island and the continuous scanning patterns were used in sample manufacturing. The effects of the scanning vector orientation, design pattern, and the island pattern size on the mechanical wear and wear anisotropy have been analyzed in detail. The study also focused upon a comparative investigation of the wear properties at the top and the side surfaces to understand the wear anisotropy in different directions. The samples are fabricated both by the fresh and the recycled powder and the role of powder state is described. The ball-on-disk test is performed to simulate the similar contact applications for marine/automotive components such as bearings. Bearing steel balls are used as a standard sliding counterpart material to investigate the wear properties. The wear microstructure is analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Overall, the island strategy with 2 mm hatch style and 45 deg scan rotation have achieved better wear resistance and friction coefficient compared with the continuous hatch style. The wear behavior is found to be anisotropic. The Raman spectra validate the presence of silicon and carbon particles on the wear track, which have a significant effect on the tribological properties. The type of particles present in the sliding zone characterizes different wear stages. Wear mechanism is described by considering four parameters, namely, scan pattern, scan vector rotation, type of powder, and the wear measurement direction. Results show that the surface wear rate of samples made by the fresh powder is lower than the recycled powder. However, samples of the recycled powder have friction modifier characteristics. The best wear rate and friction coefficient values are obtained with the island strategy (2 mm hatch, 45 deg scan rotation) in the side plane and are 3.76 x 10(-6) mm(3)/N m, 0.0781, respectively.

Functionalizing magnet additive manufacturing with in-situ magnetic field source	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						3-D printing; Bonded magnets; In-situ alignment; Magnetic material recycling	BONDED MAGNETS; FABRICATION; ALIGNMENT	Additive manufacturing via 3-D printing technologies have become a frontier in materials research, including its application in the development and recycling of permanent magnets. This work addresses the opportunity to integrate magnetic field sources into 3-D printing process in order to enable printing, alignment of anisotropic permanent magnets or magnetizing of magnetic filler materials, without requiring further processing. A non-axisymmetric electromagnet-type field source architecture was designed, modelled, constructed, installed to a fused filament commercial 3-D printer, and tested. The testing was performed by applying magnetic field while printing composite anisotropic Nd-Fe-B + Sm-Fe-N powders bonded in Nylon12 (65 vol.%) and recycled Sm-Co powder bonded in PLA (15 vol.%). Magnetic characterization indicated that the degree-of-alignment of the magnet powders increased both with alignment field strength (controlled by the electric current applied to the magnetizing system) and the printing temperature. Both coercivity and remanence were found to be strongly dependent on the degree-of-alignment, except for printing performed below but near the Curie temperature of Nd-Fe-B (310 degrees C). At applied field of 0.15 kOe, Sm-Co and hybrid Nd-Fe-B/Sm-Fe-N printed samples showed degrees-of-alignment of 83 % and 65 %, respectively. The variations in coercivity were consistent with previous observations in bonded magnet materials. This work verifies that integration of magnetic field sources into 3-D printing processes will result in magnetic alignment of particles while ensuring that other advantages of 3-D printing are retained.

These cost barriers can be surmounted by eliminating the entire process of fusing filament by three-dimensional (3-D) printing products directly from polymer granules. Fused granular fabrication (FGF) (or fused particle fabrication (FPF)) is being held back in part by the accessibility of low-cost pelletizers and choppers. An open-source 3-D printable invention disclosed here allows for precisely controlled pelletizing of both single thermopolymers as well as composites for 3-D printing. The system is designed, built, and tested for its ability to provide high-tolerance thermopolymer pellets with a number of sizes capable of being used in an FGF printer. In addition, the chopping pelletizer is tested for its ability to chop multi-materials simultaneously for color mixing and composite fabrication as well as precise fractional measuring back to filament. The US$185 open-source 3-D printable pelletizer chopper system was successfully fabricated and has a 0.5 kg/h throughput with one motor, and 1.0 kg/h throughput with two motors using only 0.24 kWh/kg during the chopping process. Pellets were successfully printed directly via FGF as well as indirectly after being converted into high-tolerance filament in a recyclebot.

To get deeper insights into its causes, this study aimed at characterizing the odor of post-consumer and recycled automotive polypropylene with different contents of talc and an anti-fogging additive. Samples were evaluated by different sensory methods currently applied by the automotive industry (GMW 3205 and VDA 270), which confirmed, that they are not feasible for reuse in interior automotive applications. As these odor evaluations are usually performed by non-trained panelists and do not allow a detailed description of the samples' single odor qualities, sensory evaluation according to ISO 13299 was performed by trained panelists. Samples showed medium-high odor intensities rated from 5.1 to 5.6, and a general dislike of the odor with hedonic ratings from 1.8 to 2.6 (scale 0-10). Their odor profiles correlated well with the odorants identified by chemo-analytical characterization using gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and two-dimensional GC-O coupled with mass spectrometry (2D-GC-MS/O). An array of odorants with benzene and phenolic structures were identified as potential contributors to the samples' overall smell and are likely to originate from degradation of additives commonly used in automotive components. While the addition of talc or anti-fogging additive did not significantly improve the odor of the samples, the description of the samples' smell and the identification of odor-active compounds related to it allow the development of avoidance strategies for the manufacturing of neutral smelling products intended for vehicles' interior applications.

It is speculative because it commits substantial resources energy, materials, shipping, handling, stocking and displaying without a guaranteed sale. It is costly because each of these resources material, process, people and place involves expense not encountered when a product is manufactured at the time of sale. It is environmentally unsustainable because, no matter how much recycling is done, not using the resources unless actually needed is always a better path. As part of the RAGNAROK (Research on Advancing Glass & Nonorganic Applications to Recreate Objects & Kinetics) project in HP Labs, we identified glass as a promising candidate for additive manufacturing based on 3-D printing methods. Glass is a silica-based material. With 90% of the earth's crust composed of silicate minerals, there will be no shortage of silica resources. Glass is easy to recycle and is environmentally friendly. Glass is inexpensive but looks precious, is pleasant to the touch and is so familiar that customers will not be disappointed by its fragility under certain conditions. A major need, and concomitantly a major challenge, for 3D printed glass is transparency. We will discuss several methods how to achieve it.

Improving Recycled Asphalt Mix Performance Through Rejuvenation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MIXTURES; PAVEMENT; BINDER	Developing technologies that provide sustainable solutions for future pavement construction is vital given the ever-increasing demand on the supply of bitumen and good-quality pavement construction materials. Recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) is a technology that presents many advantages in cost and environmental savings. This study investigated the performance of RAP mixes containing rejuvenation additives to determine the effects of those additives on the deformation (rutting) resistance, cracking resistance, and fatigue performance of RAP mixes. Laboratory testing was conducted on 11 RAP mixes that were manufactured with RAP proportions of 15% and 30%, as well as with the addition of different types of rejuvenating agents. Results produced useful performance indicators for the use of rejuvenation additives in RAP. The mixes that had rejuvenation additives preserved the high deformation resistance of RAP mixes, particularly at the higher RAP proportion of 30% when compared with a mix with no RAP, and concurrently the addition of rejuvenators counteracted against overstiffening effects of RAP. The addition of RAP, especially 30% RAP proportion, had poorer fatigue performance than when only 15% RAP was used, but with the use of rejuvenation agents, the fatigue performance of the high RAP mixes improved significantly. Use of a maltene fraction for RAP rejuvenation had marginally better fatigue performance than a chemical rejuvenation agent. The research results provide a valuable understanding of the behavior of RAP mixes and, in particular, the positive performance results that can be gained by using rejuvenation additives.

This chapter investigates wood filler-reinforced polymer composites, which have gained attention among the researchers and in the market in woody applications having aesthetic and low service costs. Most polymers have the increasing cost of petrochemical products while LC materials are obtained from different national resources such as different types of wood powder. LC materials are available in light, cheap, environment-friendly forms with easy maintenance. The main disadvantages of LC-reinforced composites are moisture sensitivity and poor dimensional stability, besides changing wood fiber characteristics in time and poor adhesion to basically all kind of matrix polymers. Additive usage in manufacturing is an increasing trend of wood-based LC material-reinforced polymer composite parts to penetrate new markets, with better performance requirements and long-term stability. This chapter investigates description, classification, production with common additive types and usage of wood-polymer composite materials. In addition, it approaches preprocesses to reach high productivity and high-quality product manufacturing. Finally, some experimental manufacturing results of wood-reinforced polymer composites are presented.

Reuse of powder feedstock for directed energy deposition	POWDER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Powder reuse; Powder recycling; Additive manufacturing; Directed energy deposition; LENS; 316L stainless steel	LASER DEPOSITION; PART I	The deposition efficiency of metal based additive manufacturing processes, particularly with directed energy deposition (DED) equipment which requires powder feedstock, is often <50%. While reuse of the remaining powder is common in industry, the precise effects on build quality resulting from possible morphological, microstructural, and chemical changes in the powder remain poorly understood. In this study, the reuse of 316L stainless steel powder in the Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS (R)) machine was investigated through multiple deposition cycles. Particular attention was paid to the influence of reusing powder on: particle morphology, flowability, agglomeration, chemical composition and microstructure, via scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis and mechanical testing of deposited parts from select reuse cycles. Results show that, for the range of parameters studied in this investigation, the physical properties of powder particles vary over multiple deposition cycles without significantly effecting the build quality of deposited parts.

Characterization of AISI 304L stainless steel powder recycled in the laser powder-bed fusion process	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Selective laser melting; Powder characterization; Powder recycling; Laser spatter	TI-6AL-4V POWDER; BEHAVIOR; SPATTER; REUSE; ROUGHNESS	During part fabrication by laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF), an Additive Manufacturing process, a large amount of energy is input from the laser into the melt pool, causing generation of spatter and condensate, both of which have the potential to settle in the surrounding powder-bed compromising its reusability. In this study, AISI 304 L stainless steel powder is subjected to seven reuses in the L-PBF process to assess the changes in powder properties that occur as a result of successive recycling. The powder was characterized morphologically by particle size and shape distribution measurements, chemically through inert gas fusion for evaluation of oxygen content, and microstructurally by X-ray diffraction for phase identification. The evolution in powder properties was used to explain observed performance differences obtained by the Hausner ratio and a Revolution Powder Analyzer for quantifying flowability. The results show that recycled powder coarsens and becomes more spherical, accrues oxygen, and accumulates delta ferrite as it is reused. Due to the change in powder morphology, recycled powder exhibited improved flowability in comparison to the virgin powder.

Evaluation of Thermal and Rheological Properties of Lubricating Greases Modified with Recycled LDPE	TRIBOLOGY TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Lubricating Greases; Additive; Recycled LDPE; Rheology; Thermal Properties	MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; FLOW; FORMULATIONS; RHEOMETRY; BEHAVIOR; CONTACT	The influence that recycled low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and lithium thickener concentrations exerts on the thermal and rheological properties of lithium lubricating greases was investigated using different rheological techniques in a temperature range of 25-175 degrees C. In this way, different lubricating grease formulations were manufactured by modifying the concentration of lithium 12-hydroxystearate and content of recycled LDPE. These lubricating greases were rheologically characterized through small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and viscous flow measurements. In addition, bomb oxidation tests (BOTs) and thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis were carried out. From the experimental results obtained, it can be deduced that modified lithium lubricating greases can be considered thermo-rheologically complex materials. Different behaviors of the viscoelastic modulus with temperature as a function of thickener and recycled LDPE concentration were found. Two types of viscous flow behavior were observed depending on the grease composition: A plateau region appeared in a wide range of shear rates and, in some cases, a minimum in the flow curve was more pronounced at high temperatures. The modified lubricating greases studied showed lower thermal and oxidation stability than unmodified lithium lubricating greases.	[Martin-Alfonso, J.

Additionally, SiC powder is used as the foaming agent. The effect of the sintering temperature, the SiC content, and the presence of additives on the pore structure as well as on the physical and mechanical properties of the CFs has been investigated. A close correlation between the sintering temperature and the pore structure of the CFs is observed. The addition of SiC at 0.5 wt% results in a substantial volume expansion of the sample and in the formation of an internal structure with uniform pores and thin pore-walls. CaO and Na2HPO4 additives allow the pores to grow and shrink and increase the uniformity, which then meets different application requirements for insulation, gardening, and in lightweight construction. We believe that the results will generalize the use of mineral waste to manufacture better ceramic products at a lower cost.

In this work, a new type of photo-reversible crosslinking resin based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and coumarin (HMC) was prepared via grafting reaction. The critical idea was to create a coumarin based photo-reversible crosslinking resin by carefully tailoring the photo-crosslinking time and temperature, so that the resin could be extruded through the nozzle and then maintain the proper shape during UV-curing. Photo-reversible crosslinking of AM resin was realized without the use of monomers, photo-initiators or propagating. A reasonable irradiation time with 354 nm (crosslink) or 254 nm UV light (cleavage) of 10 min was critical for photo-reversible crosslinking of PVA-g-HMC at 120 degrees C. An important result of this work was that the developed photo-reversible crosslinked resin could be reused and the printed resin exhibits excellent adhesion properties, thermal conductivity and oxygen barrier performance.

Recently, polypropylene (PP) was introduced by Hewlett-Packard for the given technology. To our knowledge, little is known about the mechanical properties of polypropylene processed by MJF technology. During this study, standardised specimens were printed under all of the major orientations of the machine's build space. Each of these orientations were represented by five samples. The specimens then underwent tensile, bending and Charpy impact tests to analyse their mechanical properties. The structural analysis was conducted to determine whether PP powder may be reused within the MJF process. The mechanical tests showed that the orientation of the samples significantly influences their mechanical response and must be carefully chosen to obtain the optimal mechanical properties of PP samples. We further showed that PP powder may be reused as the MJF process does not significantly alter its thermal and structural properties.

During this type of processes, a high-energy laser selectively melts the powder according to a specific CAD (computer aided design) model layer by layer, until the final three-dimensional object is fabricated. The interaction between the high-energy laser and the metal particles can result in the contamination of the powder bed through a variety of phenomena including agglomeration, partial melting, and oxidation of metal particles, condensation of the metallic vapor and generation of spatters. These phenomena can alter both the properties of the reused powder and the surface, microstructural and mechanical properties of the final part. The subject of study is a mitigation strategy for these effects through to the mixing of virgin and recycled powder in the case of MS1 maraging steel (18Ni300).

The recycled polymers were acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene (PE), which were collected from among the construction and demolition waste (CDW) at a local waste management center. The commercial additives, such as a coupling agent and lubricant, were also included in the materials. Composite materials were manufactured with an agglomeration and an extrusion process. Water absorption and thickness swelling properties of composites, based on the recycled ABS and PE, were restricted compared to the recycled PP. The strength properties of WPC were determined with two methods, a traditional Brinell hardness and resistance to indentation. Using an ABS polymer as a matrix in the composite, the moisture and strength properties were improved. The recycled PP polymer caused these properties to be lowered, especially in the case of moisture properties. This study has shown that the method used can affect the measured value of certain properties. In addition, the sorting of recycled polymer fractions is desirable for the appearance of improved properties.

It is shown that physically recycled PET can be used in the blends with other polymers, such as high and low density polyethylene, polycarbonates, polyvinyl chloride, etc. The compatibilizers and other additives often are used to obtain valuable blends of recycled PET with virgin or other plastics. Molecular weights of blended polymers must be similar to obtain the compatible blends of recycled PET with other plastics, therefore, additional processes are needed for the lowering average molecular weights of the polymers. Chemically recycled PET by esterifying the polyester with an excess of reactant such as diols, diamines, alcohols, or water can be used as starting ingredients for synthesis of other polymers. A focus on the production of oligoesters coming from the glycolysis of PET waste that have been introduced as a starting material in the manufacture of polyurethanes, unsaturated polyesters and saturated polyester plasticizers is done. A possibility of new application of acrylate/methacrylate PET oligomers for UV curable coatings, useful for wood surfaces, paints and other applications is decribed.

Spatter formation during laser beam melting of AlSi10Mg and effects on powder quality	10TH CIRP CONFERENCE ON PHOTONIC TECHNOLOGIES [LANE 2018]	Procedia CIRP		English	Proceedings Paper	10th CIRP Conference on Photonic Technologies (LANE)	SEP 03-06, 2018	Furth, GERMANY	Bayerisches Laserzentrum GmbH, Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Photon Technologies, Int Acad Prod Engn		Additive manufacturing; Laser beam melting; Powder bed fusion; Powder recycling; Powder reuse; Spatter; AlSi10Mg; Reusability; Oxidation; Powder quality	316L STAINLESS-STEEL; MECHANISMS	Cost and resource efficiency of Laser Beam Melting (LBM) highly depend on powder recycling procedures. Non-solidified powder can be sieved and reused in subsequent build cycles. However, due to quality concerns, powder recycling is not commonly practiced. One effect, which can impair the powder quality, lies in the formation and insertion of spatter particles during the melting process. In this paper, spatter particles emerging during LBM of AlSi10Mg are characterized regarding geometric (size, morphology), chemical (alloy composition, oxygen content, oxide layer thickness) properties as well as mass. Spatter particles are collected during the process using two isolation methods. Three types of spatter particles can be differentiated by their formation mechanism. It is found that spatter particles can differ significantly in oxide layer thickness and particle size. A significant share of spatter particles can be segregated by sieving. However, a certain fraction of the spatter particles will be included in the recycled powder. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In order to lead this advanced manufacturing technique toward cleaner production and to save costs, this study addresses the ability to remanufacture a wide range of commercially available filaments. Most of them either tend to degrade by chain scission or crosslinking. Only polypropylene (PP)-based filaments appear to be particularly thermally stable and therefore suitable for multiple remanufacturing sequences. As the extrusion step exerts the largest influence on the material in terms of temperature and shear load, this study focused on the morphological, rheological, thermal, processing, tensile, and impact properties of a promising PP composite in the course of multiple consecutive extrusions as well as the impact of additional heat stabilizers. Even after 15 consecutive filament extrusions, the stabilized additively manufactured PP composite revealed an unaltered morphology and therefore the same tensile and impact strength as the initial material. As the viscosity of the material of the 15th extrusion was nearly identical to that of the 1st extrusion sequence, the processability both in terms of extrusion and FFF was outstanding, despite the tremendous amount of shear and thermal stress that was undergone. The present work provides key insights into one possible step toward more sustainable production through FFF.

The major homologue in commercial PBDE mixtures are listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and are scheduled for global elimination. Hence, to understand more about unintentional contamination of plastic recycling stream by restricted PBDEs, we examined 540 small plastic consumer products (1139 components after dismantling), including children's toys, purchased in 18 countries (mainly Japan) between 2015 and 2019. Handheld X-ray fluorescence analysis revealed that 219 plastic components (19% of the total samples) contained bromine at a concentration of >30 mg kg- 1. Chemical analysis of these bromine-positive components revealed that 109 pieces (9.6% of the total), mainly those made of blackcolored plastic, contained PBDEs at concentrations ranging between 35 and 10,000 mg kg- 1, with the maximum contribution from decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE). These PBDE concentrations were insufficient to impart flame retardancy, suggesting that the recycled plastic used to manufacture these consumer products probably originated from electronic waste, the manufacture of which was the primary use of commercial decaBDE mixtures. PBDEs were also found in secondary raw plastic materials and their final products obtained in India in 2019, demonstrating that plastics containing decaBDE end up in products where they serve no functional purpose. To contribute to the circular economy, the recycling of plastic waste in end-of-life products should be promoted. However, urgent action is needed to prevent plastic additives of concern, including PBDEs, from entering new products used in daily lives, particularly those used by children.

J	Kojima, A; Furukawa, S				Kojima, A; Furukawa, S			Recycling of resin matrix composite materials .7. Future perspective of FRP recycling	ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Article						FRP; material recycling; recycle; aggregates; construction materials		Resin matrix composites reinforced by glass fibers and carbon fibers (FRPs) are used extensively for many industrial applications, such as construction materials, automobiles, ships and sporting goods, because of their high strength, ease of molding, light weight, durability, and resistance to corrosion, shock and abrasion. However, despite its many superior properties, it is difficult to resource and recycle FRP after its disposition. In this report, the recycling technology of FRP that has been developed is introduced as well as an outline of new recycling technology of FRP developed by the authors. FRP fine powders are made from waste FTP moldings using a fine powder crusher. The average grain size of these fine powders is 15-20 mu m. FRP fine powder was examined as a possible additive to paints and it was found that it increased the tensile strength of the paints. FRP can also be recycled as filler for FRP resin. FRPs were also examined for possible civil and construction materials and they were found to be useful as aggregates for concrete secondary products. After examining these manufacturing conditions in detail, by fabricating light and high-strength mortars and investigating strength prediction and water solubility after extended time, it was found to be a practical material. Burned ashes from FRP showed superior properties as mortar concrete expansive admixtures. It was concluded that FRPs, which used to be hard-to-destroy and hard-to-recycle materials, can be recycled for many industrial materials after crushing into fine powders.

According to this logic, it is necessary to consider the AM as a valid support to both innovation and growth of many sectors in which creativity and design capacity play a strategic role for original solutions. The multidisciplinary approach and the collaboration between research institutes, companies, laboratories and universities, characterize the design and experimentation of the Biocycle. This has enabled the development of a new bicycle according to eco-design and bio-design criteria, by using recycled materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), by introducing the principles of the environmental design into the definition of the entire product life cycle and by merging traditional production methods with AM to optimize the performance and reduce the overall weight, costs, and production time of the frame. To support the design phase, also a finite element (FE) model was developed. The aim is to obtain lightweight performing components with compact and ergonomic dimensions for the eco-bike. This leads to the synthesis of new unconventional shapes and a better distribution of the material from the topological-functional optimization analysis as well as AM.

Effect of powder reuse on mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V produced through selective laser melting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRACTORY METALS & HARD MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Powder Metallurgy and Additive Manufacturing of Titanium (PMTi)	SEP 24-27, 2019	Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT		Univ Utah	Powder reuse; Powder recycling; Titanium; Additive manufacturing; Direct metal laser sintering	RECYCLABILITY	Metallic powder reuse presents attractive economic and environmental advantages for direct metal laser sintering (DMLS). However, continuous recycling of powder raises concerns of powder quality and sintered part performance, and complicates process validation. Efforts to examine the mechanical response of parts built with reused feedstocks are increasingly common in the technical literature, but none have optimized process parameters in DMLS to control for changes in material properties. In this paper, titanium powder reuse was investigated with the objective of optimizing the additive manufacturing (AM) process for reuse. Virgin Ti-6Al-4V powder was cycled a total of eight times through conditions representative of industrial DMLS machines. A full 2(3)-factorial design of experiments (DOE) approach was employed to identify how parameter settings affect mechanical behavior, and include reuse as a process variable. The independent factors (laser power, laser speed, and hatch distance) did not significantly affect mechanical properties; however, measurements of ductility were found to be influenced by some interaction between the factors. These results were attributed to the narrow operating envelope which was required for successfully sintered specimens. Density and chemistry measurements further demonstrated no significant change with respect to reuse. The findings suggest that titanium powder can be reused up to eight times without any noticeable loss in strength or ductility.

Closing the Nuclear Fuel Cycle with a Simplified Minor Actinide Lanthanide Separation Process (ALSEP) and Additive Manufacturing	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TALSPEAK; COMPLEXES; KINETICS; ACIDS	Expanded low-carbon baseload power production through the use of nuclear fission can be enabled by recycling long-lived actinide isotopes within the nuclear fuel cycle. This approach provides the benefits of (a) more completely utilizing the energy potential of mined uranium, (b) reducing the footprint of nuclear geological repositories, and (c) reducing the time required for the radiotoxicity of the disposed waste to decrease to the level of uranium ore from one hundred thousand years to a few hundred years. A key step in achieving this goal is the separation of long-lived isotopes of americium (Am) and curium (Cm) for recycle into fast reactors. To achieve this goal, a novel process was successfully demonstrated on a laboratory scale using a bank of 1.25-cm centrifugal contactors, fabricated by additive manufacturing, and a simulant containing the major fission product elements. Americium and Cm were separated from the lanthanides with over 99.9% completion. The sum of the impurities of the Am/Cm product stream using the simulated raffinate was found to be 3.2 x 10(-3) g/L. The process performance was validated using a genuine high burnup used nuclear fuel raffinate in a batch regime. Separation factors of nearly 100 for Eu-154 over Am-241 were achieved. All these results indicate the process scalability to an engineering scale.

Remote sensing imagery in UAVs are evidently exhibiting its remarkable reliability, efficiency and integrability. Furthermore, technological advancements in additive manufacturing enable rapid prototyping of designs in a more cost-effective manner. This paper describes the design, construction and testing of a UAV with a foldable airframe, manufactured from recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) plastic, through 3D printing filament for the purpose of remote sensing. Previous contributions demonstrated the ability of manufacturing UAVs from recycled plastic and the feasibility of utilizing PET. This paper further develops the design, functionality and application of the UAV through additional material testing, design optimization and added design features. The new UAV design features include; propeller protection to enable remote sensing in isolated and inaccessible areas, integrated printed circuit board (PCB) to power onboard systems and reduce cable clutter, and material testing and analysis for usability of PET in multiple extreme weather environments. Moreover, the optimized UAV design will allow ease of integration with onboard systems, as well as cater for multiple interchangeable rotor arm designs, including protected and unprotected propeller designs. The objective of the research and investigation is focused on the development and implementation of cost-effective and environmentally sustainable UAVs. This paper strives to enable UAV manufacturers to rapidly prototype and optimize UAV designs, while simultaneously deterring PET plastic pollution globally, with negligible effect on UAV functionality.

Spattering is an unavoidable phenomenon taking place during the process which results in reconstituted particles falling within the powder bed. These are known to influence the interaction between the incident laser beam and the powder. These particles can consequently have a negative effect on final part integrity and quality of recycled powder. Hence, it is crucial to assess the characteristics of spatter particles to avoid the printing of defective parts. This work reports a detailed characterisation of spatter matter generated during the selective laser melting of stainless steel. To better assess the characteristics of the spatter, the spattered material was benchmarked against the virgin powder. The results showed no significant variation between the virgin and spattered particles in terms of the bulk material crystal structure. However, the spatter particles' morphological, surface chemical, optical and physical properties assessed do differ significantly from those of the virgin powder. The results presented in this work are of significant contribution to the powder bed fusion field of additive manufacturing as they provide a unique insight to the characteristics of spatter matter generated from the processing of 316L stainless steel powder.

The manufacturing of such thermoplastic resins and products has increased dramatically over the last 70 years. The plastics based on polyolefins, polystyrenes, and polyesters occupy the largest share (80%) of the world's plastic markets. However, the disposal of waste plastics has created considerable environmental concerns. Therefore, environment protection agencies and plastic manufacturers are constantly seeking appropriate techniques for recycling or upcycling waste plastics into new products. In recent years, the recycling rates are approximately 9 to 15% out of total plastics produced annually in the United States and Europe, which are predominantly limited to individual plastic fractions such as HDPE and PET. The recycling process is associated with various expensive and time-consuming sorting techniques, which are not economically attractive to the recycling industries. A significant issue is when multiple plastics are blended, they often are not chemically compatible, resulting in phase separation and inferior-quality materials. Therefore, it is important to apply certain performance modifiers during the re-extrusion of waste thermoplastics, which include compatibilizers, coupling agents, impact modifiers, and many others. There are different additives and techniques available, suitable to improve the mechanical and other associated properties of polymer blends and composites, and these can also be used for improving the performance of recycled thermoplastics. This review article summarizes various chemical additives and approaches, which can be used in thermomechanical upcycling of waste thermoplastics to new materials with superior mechanical performance via improving interfacial adhesion or phase homogeneity of polymer blends.

Most previous work focused on Engineered Nanoparticles (ENP). This paper examines some recently introduced production routes in terms of generated nano-sized by-products. A discussion on the hazards of emitting such particles and fibers is included. Fine by-products were found in recycled metal powder after 3D printing by Selective Laser Melting (SLM). The process somehow generated small round metal particles (similar to 1-2 mu m) that are possibly carcinogenic and respirable, but not small enough to enter by skin-absorption. With preventive measures like closed handling and masks, any health related effects can be prevented. The composite manufacturing in particular generated ceramic and carbonaceous particles that are very small and respirable but do not appear to be intrinsically toxic. The smallest features in agglomerates were about 30 nm. Small particles and fibers that were not attached in agglomerates were found in a wide range of sizes, from 1 mu m and upwards. Preventive measures like closed handling and masks are strongly recommended. In contrast, the more traditional production route of fabric production is investigated. Here, brushing residue and recycled wool from fabric production contained few nano-sized by-products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Material deposition processes can achieve infinite geometries. They have advanced from rapid prototyping and model-scale markets to applications in the fabrication of functional products, large objects, and the construction of full-scale buildings. Many international projects have been realised in recent years, and the construction industry is beginning to make use of such dynamic technologies. Advantages of integrating 3D printing with house construction are significant. They include the capacity for mass customisation of designs and parameters to meet functional and aesthetic purposes, the reduction in construction waste from highly precise placement of materials, and the use of recycled waste products in layer deposition materials. With the ultimate goal of improving construction efficiency and decreasing building costs, the researchers applied Strand 7 Finite Element Analysis software to a numerical model designed for 3D printing a cement mix that incorporates the recycled waste product high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The result: construction of an arched, truss-like roof was found to be structurally feasible in the absence of steel reinforcements, and lab-sized prototypes were manufactured according to the numerical model with 3D printing technology. 3D printing technologies can now be customised to building construction. This paper discusses the applications, advantages, limitations, and future directions of this innovative and viable solution to affordable housing construction.

Metal finishing activities such as printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing generate large volumes of rinse water slightly contaminated with inorganic chemicals and organic additives. While the former can be removed with proven technologies, there is a need for effective processes for elimination of trace organics in order to allow recycling of rinse water without negative impact on process bath quality. A cooperative research project started recently to study a water recycling process adapted to this need, able to remove 95% of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the rinse water by combining proven membrane separation with an innovative chemical oxidation. Two types of advanced oxidations based on the conjunction of heterogeneous catalysts with oxidants will be specifically investigated. In a preliminary stage of the project, the experimental tests were performed with a set of model compounds, selected from among the chemicals most frequently used in the plating processes, namely chelating agents, surfactants and corrosion inhibitors. These compounds were oxidized comparatively by ozone and catalytic ozonation. The differences between standard oxidation and catalytic oxidation are presented and discussed. (C) 1997 IAWQ.

It is shown that this process can save up to 7.5 wt% of virgin material usage in each processing cycle. At the same time, the thermal stability and stiffness of the composite increases with the proportion of recyclate introduced. Contemporarily, the shear and bending properties have also been observed to improve. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) showed that the changes observed are due to an increase in molecular weight with the recyclate content. In particular, a correlation between the molecular weight and the shear properties of the composite was discovered using single fibre push-out tests.

In that sense, recycled polyurethane foam (PUF) particles were added (up to 10% wt/wt) to thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) to prepare 3D printed products. From the results, it was observed that the presence of PUF particles reduces the density of filaments. Moreover, even though filler and matrix are polyurethane (PU) polymers, the fact that PUF scraps consists of crosslinked PU, it affects inter-layer adhesion, reducing the mechanical performance of the 3D printed specimens, especially when high PUF particles contents were used. Nonetheless, despite of the limitations identified, the addition of PUF particles did not affect the thermal stability of the composites, meaning that these composites can be processed at high temperatures. Therefore, PUF scraps were successfully reused which proved to be a low cost additive for the production 3D printed composites (when using low content), with the advantage of being an alternative to the disposal of PUF.

This is attributed to this process being popularized as a sustainable technology with the potential to substitute the energy intensive, wasteful and environmentally unfriendly traditional techniques. However, during processing a significant fraction of the injected powders do not end up as part of the final component. The properties of these powders change due to heating resulting in coalescence and possible chemical reactions with the surrounding environment. A potential way to overcome this is by adopting an effective powder recycling procedure by which material use efficiency can be improved. Even so, these changes may have detrimental impact on the mechanical properties of the end-product. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of powder recycling on mechanical properties as a consequence of a change in powder characteristics. The potential for improving the LENS process by powder recycling process has been evaluated by comparatively studying the feedstock characteristics, i.e. morphology, particle size distribution and microstructure of powders in as received state and after laser exposure during repeated deposition cycles. Microstructures, micro-hardness and Density of the built samples were measured after the first deposition-normalization-reuse cycle. The results revealed a correlation between the powder characteristics and the properties of the corresponding built sample used for that specific deposition.	[Sibisi, P. N.; Popoola, A.

Effect of Powder Reuse Times on Additive Manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V by Selective Electron Beam Melting	JOM			English	Article								An advantage of the powder-bed-based metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes is that the powder can be reused. The powder reuse or recycling times directly affect the affordability of the additively manufactured parts, especially for the AM of titanium parts. This study examines the influence of powder reuse times on the characteristics of Ti-6Al-4V powder, including powder composition, particle size distribution (PSD), apparent density, tap density, flowability, and particle morphology. In addition, tensile samples were manufactured and evaluated with respect to powder reuse times and sample locations in the powder bed. The following findings were made from reusing the same batch of powder 21 times for AM by selective electron beam melting: (i) the oxygen (O) content increased progressively with increasing reuse times but both the Al content and the V content remained generally stable (a small decrease only); (ii) the powder became less spherical with increasing reuse times and some particles showed noticeable distortion and rough surfaces after being reused 16 times; (iii) the PSD became narrower and few satellite particles were observed after 11 times of reuse; (iv) reused powder showed improved flowability; and (v) reused powder showed no measurable undesired influence on the AM process and the samples exhibited highly consistent tensile properties, irrespective of their locations in the powder bed. The implications of these findings were discussed.	[Tang, H. P.; Qian, M.; Liu, N.; Zhang, X. Z.; Yang, G.

Adhesively bonded joints in components manufactured via selective laser melting	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; selective laser melting; adhesive bonding; surface post-treatment; adhesive strength	ALUMINUM-ALLOYS; HEAT-TREATMENT; SURFACE; ALSI10MG; PRETREATMENT	Additive manufacturing has gained increasing attention in recent years in numerous industrial sectors due to its inherent characteristics, e.g. tool-free production and unprecedented freedom of design. However, in some applications such as heat exchangers the design has to follow certain restrictions, e.g. to allow for the removal of unfused powder, which can be enclosed in cavities. Moreover, in case multi-material parts are considered, the use of different powders during processing is often uneconomical since powder recycling is highly challenging. Therefore, the production of complex structures being characterized by limited accessibility and components made of different materials often require a subsequent joining process. Based on an analysis of state-of-the-art joining technologies employed for additively manufactured metal components, research gaps related to adhesive bonding are deduced. In light of the prevailing gaps, the influence of selective laser melting process parameters like laser power and build direction on the surface topography and, thus, on the bondability of the substrates are investigated. The mechanical tests reveal a high bond strength for the vertically oriented samples and the samples manufactured with a laser power of 400 W. Furthermore, a laser post-treatment of the SLM samples lead to an improvement of lap shear strength. Finally, results reporting on the ageing behaviour of these joints and an outlook on further research activities are given.

Minimizing the environmental impact of the papermaking process	SECOND INTERNATIONAL PAPERMAKING AND ENVIRONMENT CONFERENCE, PROCEEDING, BOOKS A AND B			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Papermaking and Environment Conference	MAY 14-16, 2008	Tianjin, PEOPLES R CHINA	Tianjin Univ Sci & Technol, Tianjin Key Lab Pulp & Paper, Dalian Polytech Univ, China Tech Assoc Paper Ind, Tianjin Tech Assoc Paper Ind		papermaking; environmental impact; sustainable; renewable resources; recycling	POLYELECTROLYTE COMPLEX DEPOSITION; CELLULOSIC FIBERS; WATER; TOXICITY; BIOCIDES; DYNAMICS	From an environmental perspective, papermakers have a positive story to tell. The products that we manufacture mainly come from renewable resources. Paper can be recycled. It's also biodegradable. It also can be incinerated to recover its energy value. However, the process of making paper also can raise some environmental concerns. Decades ago it was common to be able to see environmental impacts of papermaking additives just by looking at a waterway downstream of a paper mill. The color of river water often was a good clue as to what color of paper was being manufactured. Such impacts have been greatly reduced, not only due to implementation of wastewater treatment operations, but also to advances in papermaking chemistry - making it possible to achieve high levels of retention efficiency. In the future we can expect there to be increasing emphasis on the overall environmental impact of each chemical additive that is used. Issues that will be considered will include the chemical's toxicity, biodegradability, and its tendency (or lack thereof) to become retained on solid surfaces. Certain papermaking additives also have the potential to reduce the need for fibers or to enable the papermaker to meet specifications at higher filler levels or lower basis weights. Further opportunities lie in the area of automation, making it possible to use chemical additives more efficiently. Looking toward the future, perhaps energy use will emerge as the dominant issue. Evaporation of water is the most energy-demanding part of the papermaking process. Though it is very difficult to demonstrate conclusively, some of the same chemicals that can promote faster dewatering in the forming section also appear to make it easier to squeeze water out of paper in the press section, reducing the amount of evaporation required.

They are not preferred in price sensitive sectors especially in automotive applications because of their high cost. On the other hand, there is a growing interest to use graphene as a reinforcing agent in composite production. At this point, graphene platelet (GNP) produced from the recycle source was used as a template for carbon nanofiber production by using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique to overcome commercialization harrier. This bicomponent and novel structure is a good candidate to be used as a reinforcing agent in compound formulations. This produced hybrid additive was dispersed in thennoplastic resin by thennokinetic mixer to get homogeneous dispersion and provide strong interfacial interactions. In the current work, the outstanding properties of graphene with carbon fibers were combined into one type structure. With the further research, the number of graphene layer were adjusted in this hybrid structure to bring a new insight in graphene and its composite applications. After the fabrication of graphene and carbon fiber-based reinforcements with different graphene sources, mechanically and thermally improved Polyamide 6.6 were developed at very low loadings by a thermokinetic high shear mixer. This developed technology will utilize an innovation to produce advanced thermoplastic prepregs including graphene and its hybrid additives with high mechanical properties and increased recycling degree by decreasing manufacturing costs.

Besides, a rubber modified bitumen was used as binder, analyzing the performance of a fatty acid amide wax as additive to decrease its viscosity at mixing temperature, and avoid the higher manufacturing temperature of this type of bitumen. Three stages were carried out to design the mixtures: first, the viscosity analysis of the rubber modified bitumen when the wax is added. Second, the experimental design of the mixtures with the alternative aggregates at conventional temperature, using the rubber modified bitumen without wax. Finally, the study of the behaviour of the three mixes with the same dosage of the previous phase, but manufactured at reduced temperature, that is including the fatty acid amide wax to the binder. The tests of the Spanish specifications have been performed to design the mixtures and compare their performance in both conditions (with and without wax): void characteristics, water sensitivity test, wheel tracking test, and Cantabro loss particle test in dry and wet conditions. The results have shown that it is feasible to design mixtures in which practically the whole mineral skeleton comes from black slag and recycled asphalt, manufacturing them with a rubber modified bitumen but at the same range of temperatures than conventional 50/70 penetration grade binder, and fulfilling the standards for any climatic zone and heavy traffic level.

The process of selective laser melting (SLM) can permit fusion of powders, including powder blends and alloys com-prised from elemental powders. In this context, exploring the possibility of making composites by blending stainless steel 316 L and glass powder (the latter being a waste product) was explored. Such composites were investigated on the basis of (i) significant reduction in component cost, as glass powder waste is a common industrial by-product, (ii) upgrading recycled waste, (iii) the possibility of lowering component density (the density of glass is less than three times that of stainless steel), and (iv) the possibility of unique physical properties if glass remains amorphous. Herein, laser scan strategies were optimised in order to produce solid cubes and tensile test specimens. Microstructural and phase analysis were carried out by electron microscopy and x-ray techniques. Unique Cr\\Si oxides were observed in the manufactured microstructure. The work herein presents an exploratory approach into the development of novel engineered composites utilising additive manufacturing. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Separation and recycling of polymeric post-industrial waste from adhesive bandages	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Adhesive bandage; Post-industrial waste; Multiple layer; Hydro-pulping; Mechanical recycling	POLYETHYLENE; DEGRADATION; ALUMINUM; PET	The use of polymer has been showing an increasing consumption in the industry for the production of several consumer goods, mainly for the manufacturing of disposable products that can involve the combination of polymers with other materials. Nowadays, the annual production of polymers in the world exceeds 300 million tons. The industrial processes for these materials lead to a wide production of post-industrial waste that are highly complex and challenging for mechanical recycling due to the difficulty in separation step of macro-contaminant for this kind of waste. In this sense, the aim of this current study was to research and develop an efficient separation process with low cost for recycling of post-industrial scraps generated from production of adhesive bandage, which consisted of multiple layer films containing polymers, copolymers and cellulose. The polymeric waste was submitted to the well-established process called hydro-pulping, which does not require the use of chemical additives, resulting in efficient separation of cellulose pulp, while the residual polymer has been submitted to the thermomechanical processing by extrusion and injection molding.

Incorporating Textile-Derived Cellulose Fibers for the Strengthening of Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate for 3D Printing Feedstock Materials	JOURNAL OF POLYMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Fused deposition modeling; Plant fiber reinforcement; Additive manufacturing; Plastic recycling; Textile recycling	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; NATURAL FIBER; COMPOSITES; POLYPROPYLENE; IMPACT; ETHICS	Unprecedented levels of production and consumption has led to solid waste accumulation in landfills and oceans. Two significant landfill constituents are textile waste and discarded plastic bottles. Since there is a finite amount of space available for landfill use, solutions that reuse these post-consumer products are imperative. The work presented here is a methodology for producing natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites (NFRPCs) from pseudo-raw materials. Post-consumer textile waste and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water bottles were made compatible by way of surface modifications. Melt compounding was used to form a monofilament feedstock for extrusion-based 3D printing platforms. Hydrolysis and functionalization of cellulose fibers from white denim cloth was performed. It was found that adding recycled textile fibers to the recycled PET matrix had a toughening effect. Materials characterization involving dynamic mechanical analysis, attenuated total reflectance, impact testing, melt flow index, and scanning electron microscopy were carried out to verify the efficacy of the functionalization process and to ascertain the robustness of the filler/matrix interface. The outcome is a demonstration of a feasible method for the repurposing of waste products for 3D printing applications.

Rheological Modification of Lubricating Greases with Recycled Polymers from Different Plastics Waste	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYOLEFIN BLENDS; BEHAVIOR; MICROSTRUCTURE; MORPHOLOGY; VIRGIN; BLACK; FTIR; FLOW; LDPE	There is a growing interest on the development of new materials based on recycled polymers from plastics waste, since the use of such plastics represents a low-cost source of raw material. The purpose of the present work is to evaluate, from a comparative point of view, the effect that different waste and virgin polymers, used as viscosity modifier additives, exert on the theological properties of standard lithium lubricating greases. Grease formulations containing diverse polymers, differing in nature and/or origin, were manufactured and theologically characterized. Particularly, the influences of the type of polymer, the molecular weight and the presence of carbon black, used as filler in recycled polymers, have been evaluated. Small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and viscous flow measurements were carried out, as well as calorimetric and thermogravimetric analysis. In general, recycled polymers induce a more important theological modification than virgin polymers of the same nature. Thus, the addition of some recycled polymers such as HDPE, LDPE, PP, and EVA copolymer to lithium lubricating grease significantly increases the values of the theological parameters analyzed. The crystallinity degree, mainly dependent on the nature of the polymer, and the carbon black content of recycled polymers have been pointed out as the most highly influencing parameters on the rheology of the lubricating greases studied. However, an apparent loss in mechanical stability for lubricating greases containing recycled polymers has been found when they were submitted to a severe mechanical treatment.	[Martin-Alfonso, J.

LBM is a promising technology that offers new opportunities for increasing resource efficiency. The aim of this study was to compare environmental impacts of conventional manufacturing methods with AM for a real industrial application. Analysis was performed on the repair process of a burner used in a Siemens industrial gas turbine. The results of this study show that the repair process based on AM provides significant reduction in material footprint (abiotic depletion potential), primary energy consumption, and carbon footprint compared to conventional machining and welding processes. Even though the AM process has increased power and inert gas consumption on the shop floor, the complete life cycle shows that the conventional processes have a much higher environmental footprint from material use upstream. Different recycling models of nickel-based alloy and stainless steel scrap strongly influence the cradle-to-gate life cycle footprint. The results show that an AM process can have a sustainability advantage if it is designed in a holistic cradle-to-gate approach. The study also shows potentials for the LBM machine developers for entry into the industrialization of AM. Energy reduction potentials were identified during the idle mode, during operation mode from the supply of cooling duty, and also related to inert gas consumption. Careful consideration of these potentials can further improve the primary energy footprint of the LBM process.

However, the use of recycled carbon fibers in 3D printing is almost unexplored, especially for thermoset-based composites. This paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of recycled carbon fibers 3D printing via UV-assisted direct ink writing. Pyrolyzed recycled carbon fibers with a sizing treatment were firstly shredded to be used as a reinforcement of a thermally and photo-curable acrylic resin. UV-differential scanning calorimetry analyses were then performed to define the material crosslinking of the 3D printable ink. Because of the poor UV reactivity of the resin loaded with carbon fibers, a rheology modifier was added to guarantee shape retention after 3D printing. Thanks to a customized 3D printer based on a commercial apparatus, a batch of specimens was successfully 3D printed. According to the tensile tests and Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis, the material shows good mechanical properties and the absence of layer marks related to the 3D printing. These results will, therefore, pave the way for the use of 3D printed recycled carbon fiber reinforced polymers in new fields of application.

In these areas of use the product's life cycle is short, therefore it quickly turns into waste. The polyethylene terephthalate (PET) - the material that is used as beverage containers are the material with the greatest environmental load. The physical recycling of PET bottles in large quantities was the research goal. During the work with the help of chemical foaming a closed cell structural foam from PET bottle was produced. The research was carried out with upcycling using chain extender and impact modifier additives. For industrial use a bromine-based flame retardant was used and excellent flame retardancy was achieved. Based on the results obtained, the material previously managed as waste, with the appropriate treatment can be involved into the manufacturing of new products.

However, additive manufacturing of PP by means of fused filament fabrication (FFF), also known as fused deposition modeling, suffers from several drawbacks like high shrinkage, massive warpage, and poor adhesion to common build plates. Herein, we overcome these problems by exploiting glass fiber-reinforced nanophase-separated PP reactor blends (Catalloy process resins). Catalloy is a polymerization process to create PP reactor blends containing dispersed ethylene/1-olefin copolymer rubber nanophases. A warpage quantification method confirms that 3D-printed Catalloy-based PP composites exhibit exceptionally low warpage and successfully compete with amorphous thermoplastics like acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene in printability, build plate adhesion, and printing precision. Microscopic imaging and the measurement of mechanical properties along and perpendicular to the 3D printing direction verify the rapid, highly efficient fusion of the deposited polymer strands. The resulting mechanical properties are very similar to those of injection-molded Catalloy-based composites even at high printing speeds. As evidenced by micro-computer tomography imaging, an unprecedented FFF process-mediated tuning of the fiber orientation is achieved. This allows for precisely tailoring both unidirectional and tuned multidirectional composites via computer design.

Recycled poly(lactic acid)-based 3D printed sustainable biocomposites: a comparative study with injection molding	MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Biodegradable polymers; Microcrystalline cellulose; Recycling; 3D printing; Mechanical properties; Chain extender	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ACID PLA; POLYMER NANOCOMPOSITES; COMPOSITES; CELLULOSE; IMPACT; CRYSTALLIZATION; POLYLACTIDE; RHEOLOGY	With the objective of giving a new economic life to postindustrial waste poly(lactic acid) (PLA), bio-composites based on recycled PLA were manufactured using conventional melt blending, and the strands produced were successfully used for three-dimensional (3D) printing of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) samples by means of the fused deposition molding (FDM) method. This article further discusses the processing advantages and challenges associated with void formation, anisotropic behavior, and the quality of the 3D printed (3DP) samples in comparison with injection-molded (IM) counterparts. The blends were manufactured containing 30 wt % of recycled PLA in a matrix of virgin PLA. Similarly, blends were also prepared with addition of an epoxy-based chain extender (CE) and as well as with the CE and a reinforcing phase of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). One of the limitations of recycled PLA in FDM-based 3D printing is its high melt flow due to the reduced molecular weight after recycling, which results in excessive material flow during extrusion, and hence limits its application in FDM-based 3D printing. Consequently, the main effect of the CE, Joncryl, was to control the Melt Flow Index (MFI) of the biocomposites containing the recycled PLA. The addition of CE also resulted in improvement of the impact strength of 3DP samples. In general, the CE in combination with the natural fibers (MCC) allowed the incorporation of postindustrial PLA. Data suggest that more recycled PLA may be incorporated by using this blend combination. In general, owing to the void formation, 3DP samples presented lower values of density (lightweight) and mechanical properties as compared with IM samples. However, the tensile strength, modulus and Izod impact strength of 3DP biocomposites were increased by up to 88%, 127%, and 11%, respectively, by the addition of 5 wt % MCC, as compared with 3DP samples based on postindustrial PLA without additives.

Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is the most used metal additive manufacturing technique, and it is based on the efficient interaction between a high-energy laser and a metal powder feedstock. To make LPBF more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly, it is of paramount importance to recycle (reuse) the unfused powder from a build job. However, since the laser-powder interaction involves complex physics phenomena and generates by-products which might affect the integrity of the feedstock and the final build part, a better understanding of the overall process should be attained. The present review paper is focused on the clarification of the interaction between laser and metal powder, with a strong focus on its side effects.

Additive technology; Industry 4.0; EDSM		Additive technology can cover both manufacturing and user segments. Common usage in households is only in its early stages and far from overshadows of industrial use. Additive technology offers economic benefits as well as simplification of logistics, minimization of inventories, guarantee of time flexibility, availability of spare and complementary parts, which redefine the lifetime of a common equipment. Individuality embedded into the production process, where any part produced by this technology can be customized according to customer's specifications (within the certain limits), allows direct influence on the user's surroundings. Innovative work that promotes uniquely creative design, as well as standardly shared templates, chosen materials, and their recycling, brings a range of options, which also entails certain risks. For the Smart City environment, it is important to secure sustainable efficiency for contained production systems. Utilizing methodologies such as EDSM [1] provides powerful tools for such technology management. To properly reflect the dynamic changes in a modern city, it is necessary to apply the principles of Industry 4.0. By implementing complete life cycle management, it should be possible to provide a secure future for additive technology as an indispensable part of a Smart City.

Consequently, it may lower the cost-effectiveness of powder bed additive manufacturing, which relies on recycling of the nonconsumed powder. This is especially the case for production of high-performance aero engine components where high material and process reliability is required. This study comprises a detailed investigation on the degradation of Alloy 718 powder during multicycle electron beam melting (EBM). The surface-sensitive analysis methods, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), were combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to depict the differences in surface morphology, and surface composition of powder samples exposed to varying numbers of re-use cycles. The results show a significant change in surface characteristics after exposing the powder to the process and the environment in the build chamber. The virgin powder is covered mainly by a relatively thin and homogeneous oxide layer. The re-used powder, however, has undergone transformation to a heterogeneous oxide layer, rich in thermodynamically stable Al-rich oxide particulates, which started already during the first build cycle. Significant growth of the Al-rich oxide occurs via selective oxidation of Al under the conditions in the build chamber, including both pick-up of oxygen from the process atmosphere and redistribution of initial surface-bound oxygen from less-stable products like Ni-oxide and/or hydroxide.

Electrochemical 3D printing is a relatively new form of AM that creates metallic structures through electrochemical reduction of metal ions from solutions onto conductive substrates. The advantage of this process is that a wide range of materials and alloys can be deposited under ambient conditions without thermal damage and more importantly at low cost, as this does not require expensive laser optics or inert gas environments. Other advantages include the fact that this process can be both additive and subtractive through reversal of potential allowing for recycling of components through electrochemical dissolution. However, one main limitation of this technology is speed. Here, a novel electrochemical 3D printer design is proposed using a meniscus confinement approach which demonstrates deposition rates three orders of magnitude higher than equivalent systems due to improved mass transport characteristics afforded through a mechanical electrolyte entrainment mechanism. Printed copper structures exhibit a polycrystalline nature, with decreasing the grain size as the potential is increased resulting in a higher Vickers hardness and electronic resistivity.

A liquid metal alloy is introduced to enhance the sensitivity of the complex and drug/liquid-reconfigurable helix topology. Moreover, the influence of the dimensions of the hemisphere inscribed by the helical turns on the resonant frequency of the structure is researched. The microfluidic channels with 1 mm radius are shaped in the form of double semispherical helix using a Form-2 3D printer. To fulfill effectively the liquid metal (LM) injection, movement and recycle for reuse, a syringe pump is integrated to flexibly control the flow of the fluid. Besides, the proof-of-concept prototype achieves excellent radiation gain and impedance matching. The realized sensitivity is 0.96 mL/GHz and 0.33 mL/GHz corresponding with the frequency shift from 2.28 to 2.01 GHz and 2.01 to 1.65 GHz.

While ideal, the use of virgin powder for every AM build is not practical or economical. It is critical to investigate new methods that will help mitigate these cost drivers and enable the use of recycled powder in AM. Presented here is initial work on the use of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) process to recondition AM powders used in laser and electron beam powder bed fusion, highlighting some challenges faced while developing optimum process parameters. The manuscript focuses on the three-dimensional characterization of used powder, before and after the plasma reconditioning process, in order to quantitatively understand the result of the ICP process on the shape and porosity of the particles. A distinct change in the morphology of the powder was observed before and after the ICP where most, but not all, irregular shaped powder particles and multi-particles were converted into more spherical particles. A detailed analysis of the percentage of spherical and non-spherical particles before and after the ICP process is also included, as well as the process' effect on particle porosity, which was different for the two powders used, Inconel 718 and Ti-6Al-4V. The results indicate the value of using the ICP process as a viable option for recycling of these two powders.	[Garboczi, E.

The purpose of this study is to find proper utilization of these waste powders by developing filaments from these powders for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process. In order to develop filament materials, polyamide powders PA 12 (Nylon material) are mixed with various weight percentages (12.5, 25, 37.5 and 50) of tungsten carbide to enhance mechanical properties. To determine the suitability of powder mixtures for FDM, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Melt flow index (MFI) tests are performed: A single screw extruder is used to process these powder mixtures to form filaments for testing. It is found that the addition of tungsten carbide has increased glass transition temperature, MFI and the strength of resulting polyamide-tungsten carbide composites. Moreover, filaments possess comparable and better strength than existing filaments, which are used to successfully build 3D parts from an FDM system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With the two-step extrusion method, dicumyl peroxide (DCP) can completely react after reactive extrusion without adding antioxidants in the first step, which increased the degree of cross-linking and the molecular weight of the recycled HDPE. Then, adding the antioxidant in the second extrusion step can avoid the conflict between the two additives. As a result, this method improved the oxidation induction time (OIT) and the environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR) value of HOPE compared with the traditional one-step extrusion method. For both Irganox 1035 and Irganox 300, the OIT using the two-step extrusion method is much higher than that using the one-step method. In addition, introducing carbon black (CB) into the black masterbatch affected the OIT. When the CB content was 0.8%, the OIT was at its maximum value.

For a sustainability assessment of a production technology, the global warming potential (GWP) can be used, which is commonly referred to as CO2-footprint. Looking at the resource demand of LBM, material losses and powder recycling play a significant role. In the LBM build-up process, powder material is selectively solidified, generating the part layer-by-layer. The non-solidified powder material can be recycled, which is beneficial to the resource efficiency of the process. Due to considerations regarding powder quality degradation, the number of reuse powder cycles in industrial practice varies significantly, ranging from only one to more than several dozen cycles. Similarly, material losses during the process have shown to differ between LBM machines. However, previous approaches for LBM resource efficiency assessment lack a detailed representation of these two factors. In this study, two interacting models are introduced for the evaluation of the GWP of LBM parts. Firstly, a powder reuse cycle calculation model is described. Secondly, a LBM resource and energy consumption model based on the CO2PE!-methodology is put forward with a refined focus on powder recycling and material losses. The models are implemented and validated based on three LBM production use cases including the acquisition of resource and energy consumption data for three commercial LBM machines. GWP-impact values are used from the ProBas database, provided by the German Federal Environmental Agency. Based on the results regarding the three LBM use cases, the role of powder recycling and material losses on the GWP-impact of LBM during the production phase is discussed. The results show that the number of attainable powder reuse cycles lies around 35 cycles (ranging from 1 to 117 cycles) for the analyzed LBM production scenarios when applying the suggested powder recycling strategy. If powder is not recycled and only used once, more than 90% of the powder batch might be discarded. The volume-specific CO2-equivalent of 0.175 kgCO(2)eq/cm(3) can be used as a rule of thumb for a quick estimation of the GWP for LBM parts made from Al-alloy or steel. Electric energy consumption constitutes for the largest share of GWP-impact, followed by the solidified metal powder and the occurring powder losses.

'Glass based stoneware' as a promising route for the recycling of waste glasses	ADVANCES IN APPLIED CERAMICS			English	Article						Ceramics; Glasses; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Recycling	LIME-SILICA GLASS; PORCELAIN STONEWARE; SINTERING BEHAVIOR; MATRIX COMPOSITES; HEATING RATE; SCRAP-GLASS; CRYSTALLIZATION; REUTILIZATION; CERAMICS	Soda-lime-silica scrap or waste glasses are almost widely accepted sintering additives for the manufacturing of traditional ceramics. Although interesting, this solution does not fully exploit the potentialities of glasses compared to feldspar fluxes. In fact, glasses exhibit the softening and consequently the ability of viscous flow sintering, at much lower temperatures than those required for feldspar melting, and this could be very useful to develop 'environmentally friendly' ceramics, i.e. made with a reduced consumption of energy and natural raw materials. In the present study, a high glass recycle approach is reported, which replaces the feldspar flux, in the formulation of porcelain stoneware, with finely powdered soda-lime glass or glasses from dismantled cathode ray tubes (CRTs). This allowed the manufacturing of ceramics at 880-920 and 750-775 degrees C, respectively. The final products were optimised by the addition of calcium hydroxide for soda lime glass and Al2O3 platelets for CRT glasses, in order to promote the partial devitrification of the glass or control the fracture propagation. Owing to their overall mechanical properties (bending strength exceeding 70 MPa, hardness exceeding 6 GPa, fracture toughness exceeding 1.1 MPa m(0.5)), the new products could find applications in the construction industry.

Assessment of warm-mix asphalt concrete containing sub-products as part of aggregate blend	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING			English	Article						Warm-mix asphalt; reclaimed asphalt pavement; recycled concrete aggregate; mechanical resistance; construction process; direct costs	RECYCLED ASPHALT; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ADDITIVES; MIXTURES; HOT; PERFORMANCE; BINDERS	The study compares warm-mix asphalt concrete (WMA) and a traditional hot mix asphalt concrete (HMA), evaluating permanent deformation, fatigue, stiffness modulus, and water sensitivity. The cost (construction only) differences are also addressed. Three WMA blends were prepared. One WMA was manufactured with the stand alone organic wax and incorporated 60% of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). The other two used organic wax embedded in cellulosic fibres, one of them incorporated 35% of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), and the other had no added sub-product. Trial sections were constructed with plant-produced mixtures, laid and compacted with conventional equipment. When considered a global indicator representing mixtures mechanical behaviour involving deformation, rutting, fatigue and moisture resistance, the results showed that performance of WMA blended with RAP and RCA was similar to HMA, and the conventional WMA was 25% better. The construction process proved to be feasible for any WMA. The direct construction costs as compared to conventional HMA were 6% higher for the conventional WMA and 5-8% lower when WMA used sub-products. The use of these sub-products is aimed to find innovative approaches to be undertaken throughout the product lifecycle, from manufacture through reuse, with the goal of reducing waste going to landfill.

The parts produced possess good strength, low weight, excellent mechanical properties and are cost-effective. This saves a considerable amount of both time and carrying cost. Thereof the challenges and opportunities that the space sector holds for AM is worth reviewing to provide a better insight into further developments and prospects for this technology. Design/methodology/approach The potentiality of 3D printing for the manufacturing of various components under space conditions has been explained. Here, the authors have reviewed the details of manufactured parts used for zero gravity missions, subjected to onboard International Space Station conditions and with those manufactured on earth. Followed by the major opportunities in 3D printing in space which include component repair, material characterization, process improvement and process development along with the new designs. The challenges such as space conditions, availability of power in space, the infrastructure requirements and the quality control or testing of the items that are being built in space are explained along with their possible mitigation strategies. Findings These components are well comparable with those prepared on earth which enables a massive cost saving. Other than the onboard manufacturing process, numerous other components and a complete robot/satellite for outer space applications were manufactured by AM. Moreover, these components can be recycled on board to produce feedstock for the next materials. The parts produced in space are bought back and compared with those built on earth. There is a difference in their nature i.e. the flight specimen showed a brittle nature and the ground specimen showed a denser nature. Originality/value The review discusses the advancements of 3D printing in space and provides numerous examples of the applications of 3D printing in space and space applications. The paper is solely dedicated to 3D printing in space. It provides a breakthrough in the literature as a limited amount of literature is available on this topic. The paper aims at highlighting all the challenges that AM faces in the space sector and also the future opportunities that await development.

The fabricated polymer components require diverse properties for different applications and some of these properties can be obtained by using polymer composite filaments consisting of various materials in different proportions. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how different properties are affected by various compositions of materials in FFF fabricated polymer components. This study evaluates and compares various properties such as microstructure and surface texture, mechanical behavior, thermal properties, and other general characteristics of different polymer composites fabricated by 3-D printing technology. For this purpose, six polymer composite specimens are prepared where Polylactic acid (PLA) and High-density polyethylene (HDPE) are the primary materials in all of them. Recycled plastic and (or) TiO2 nanoparticles are mixed in four specimens, and graphene coating is done in two samples. Extruded filaments are consumed in the (FFF process, where the process parameters are determined under an optimization model from machine learning. FESEM, EDX, and Particle analysis confirm that the nozzle temperature, derived from machine learning, perfectly aligns with the polymers' surface texture, layer, and microstructure. Graphene-coated samples show good profiles in roughness testing. Regarding mechanical behavior analysis, tensile strength, elongation, and hardness tests are conducted. Here, the sample infused with 1% nanoparticle but void of recycled plastic presents sufficient mechanical strength, and the graphene-coated samples show the improved property in terms of elongation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis authenticated the thermal properties of the samples. FTIR analysis identified the general characteristics in all specimens except the one with graphene-coating and recycled plastic.

Recycled tire crumbs and other additives can be incorporated to the new material to form a noise-absorptive barrier panel. Using recycled rubber tire as noise absorption material has been proved to be satisfactory Intact tire can be filled into the noise barrier to provide air gap for the powder tire and give sufficient reduction of sound between 250 Hz and 500 Hz which are the dominant frequencies of traffic noise. The panel with tire components as absorption material can effectively reduce noise reflection. Compared to fragile conventional absorption material that is easy damaged, absorptive material made of waste tire is economical, highly durable and effective without any adverse effects. The study demonstrates that rubber tire has great potential to be further developed into a practical absorption material for reducing transportation noise.										5	1	1	0	2	DAAAM INT VIENNA	WIEN	VIENNA UNIV TECHNOLOGY, KARLSPLATZ 13, WIEN, A-1040, AUSTRIA	1726-9679		978-3-901509-68-1	ANN DAAAM			2008							885	886					2	Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Manufacturing	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering	BIU04	WOS:000262860100442					2022-01-29

WHY SIMULATE A SAMPLE OF RECYCLED WOOD?	MADERAS-CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA			English	Article						Recovered wood; particle size; sample size; heavy metals; AAS and ICP-AES		Wood products follow the same cycle as other materials: manufacture, use and disposal. For certain applications, chemical additives are added to wood to increase its durability against biological and physical attack. At the end of life, waste wood is chipped or crushed before being recovered as raw material for new products or as fuel for energy. In recycled wood, there is the potential that some wood particles are contaminated by hazardous substances, such as organic or heavy metal preservatives. Therefore there is a need for a quality control method of assessing recovered wood that is on the one hand sufficiently precise and on the other not too expensive to preclude the use of recycling wood in to new products. This paper covers some preliminary research that is part of a large study that aims to develop a robust analytical method for recovered wood. However the extreme variability of recovered wood makes it difficult to develop such protocols on real recovered wood samples. Consequently, model chip piles with known contamination levels were created to simulate real world recovered wood samples.	[Bouslamti, A.; Irle, M.

The plastic cable waste is incorporated into the gypsum matrix without going through any type of selection and/or treatment, as it is obtained after the cable recycling process. In the experimental process, gypsum boards of different dimensions were manufactured and tested for their Young's modulus, shock-impact resistance, flexural strength, thermal conductivity, and thermal comfort. The results obtained show a significant increase in the elasticity of the boards with plastic waste (limited cracking), compliance with the minimum value of flexural strength, and a slight improvement in the thermal conductivity coefficient (lower energy demand) and surface comfort (reduced condensation and greater adherence). Therefore, the analyzed material could provide a suitable alternative to currently marketed gypsum boards, contributing to sustainable construction not only in new constructions, but also in building renovations.

J	Lin, CC				Lin, CC			Recycling technology of poly(ethylene terephthalate) materials	MACROMOLECULAR SYMPOSIA			English	Article								Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has become one of major post consumer plastics wastes, in addition to polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). The challenge to large-volume plastics companies is to team how to collect, separate, reprocess and market their low-cost products and make a profit, too. The effort of. PET recycling, however, is the most successful story in the plastic recycling technology, including both reclaim and upgrade of PET waste. Beverage bottles made of PET are recycled more than 20 % of the total production. The technology of today can reclaim the postconsumer PET bottles to produce high-quality granulated PET with better than 99 % purity. A practical reclaim process for recycling PET bottles (including bottle, HDPE base cup, aluminum cap, liner, label and adhesive) is available by the Center for Plastics Recycling Research in USA. PET recycling process, like for other plastics, can be divided into three categories: incineration, physical recycling, and chemical recycling. To make the plastic recycling business pay requires more than simple recovery and marketing. Greatest profit potential is in upgraded and value-added reclaim products. Upgrading involves compounding with additives to make material more processable, adding reinforcement, or producing extrusions or finished parts from reclaim resins. For instance, a modified injection-moldable resin made from PET bottle scrap is claimed to provide high impact and processability at less cost than competitive materials. It is foreseen that chemical recycling of waste PET bottle becomes feasible if the price of raw material goes up. Three economical processes are involved in this technology: pyrolysis, hydrocracking, and hydrolysis. The hydrolysis process is presently employed to recover the raw material for unsaturated polyester resin manufacture or polyols for the production of polyurethane resin. It is reported in this presentation that polymer concrete could be a huge potential market for chemical reclaim of PET materials, especially for green or mixed-color PET, which are priced lower than colorless PET reclaim materials.

Hollow fly-ash cenospheres were blended by 40 wt.% in a HDPE matrix to produce syntactic foam (HDPE40) filaments. Further, the recycling potential was studied by pelletizing the filaments again to extrude twice (2x) and three times (3x). The filaments were tensile tested at 10(-4) s(-1), 10(-3) s(-1), and 10(-2) s(-1) strain rates. HDPE40 filaments show an increasing trend in modulus and strength with the strain rate. Higher density and modulus were noticed for 2x filaments compared to 1x filaments because of the crushing of some cenospheres in the extrusion cycle. However, 2x and 3x filament densities are nearly the same, showing potential for recycling them. The filaments show better properties than the same materials processed by conventional injection molding. Micro-CT scans show a uniform dispersion of cenospheres in all filaments.

To assist the technical evolution of these systems, this study provided the details of an invention for a low-cost, easily replicable open-source grinding machine for compression screw manufacturing. The system itself can be largely fabricated using FPF/FGF following the self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) methodology. This grinding machine can be made from a cordless cut-off grinder and < $155 in parts. The new invention is demonstrated to be able to cut custom screws with variable (i) channel depths, (ii) screw diameters, (iii) screw lengths, (iv) pitches, (v) abrasive disk thicknesses, (vi) handedness of the screws, (vii) and materials (three types of steel tested: 1045 steel, 1144 steel, and 416 stainless steel). The results show that the device is more than capable of replicating commercial screws as well as providing makers with a much greater flexibility to make custom screws. This invention enables the DRAM toolchain to become even more self-sufficient, which assists the goals of the circular economy.

J	Haussler, M; Eck, M; Rothauer, D; Mecking, S				Haeussler, Manuel; Eck, Marcel; Rothauer, Dario; Mecking, Stefan			Closed-loop recycling of polyethylene-like materials	NATURE			English	Article							CHAIN; POLYOLEFINS; ACIDS; OILS	Plastics are key components of almost any technology today. Although their production consumes substantial feedstock resources, plastics are largely disposed of after their service life. In terms of a circular economy(1-8), reuse of post-consumer sorted polymers ('mechanical recycling') is hampered by deterioration of materials performance(9,10). Chemical recycling(1,11) via depolymerization to monomer offers an alternative that retains high-performance properties. The linear hydrocarbon chains of polyethylene(12) enable crystalline packing and provide excellent materials properties(13). Their inert nature hinders chemical recycling, however, necessitating temperatures above 600 degrees Celsius and recovering ethylene with a yield of less than 10 per cent(3,11,14). Here we show that renewable polycarbonates and polyesters with a low density of in-chain functional groups as break points in a polyethylene chain can be recycled chemically by solvolysis with a recovery rate of more than 96 per cent. At the same time, the break points do not disturb the crystalline polyethylene structure, and the desirable materials properties (like those of high-density polyethylene) are fully retained upon recycling. Processing can be performed by common injection moulding and the materials are well-suited for additive manufacturing, such as 3D printing. Selective removal from model polymer waste streams is possible. In our approach, the initial polymers result from polycondensation of long-chain building blocks, derived by state-of-the-art catalytic schemes from common plant oil feedstocks, or microalgae oils(15). This allows closed-loop recycling of polyethylene-like materials. Polycarbonates and polyesters with materials properties like those of high-density polyethylene can be recycled chemically by depolymerization to their constituent monomers, re-polymerization yielding material with uncompromised processing and materials properties.

Waste is used as additive in the production of a certain number of products. It enables to reduce the costing price per piece and to enhance some of the properties of the material, and to reduce pollution problems. To meet the various criteria, and manufacturing requirements of contemporary ceramic tile and bring a solution to our environment, an addition of waste glass from lamps public lighting and neon (cutlet) is incorporated in various ceramic masse for substituted a feldspar. A comparative study is made between the properties obtained with each type of waste on the one hand and the other with the properties of tile produced in the industry. It was found that the tiles made with waste glass lighting lamps offer higher mechanical strength than that obtained with the feldspar and a good agreement between the shard - enamel. Although the value of strength obtained with the waste of neon is lower than that obtained with the first type of glass. The latter always remains higher than that of industrial value.

This problematic situation stresses the need for increased plastic collection, recycling and reuse rates. Extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) and especially fused filament fabrication (FFF) offer an efficient and effective method to reuse and upcycle recycled plastic. This study focuses on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), which has a broad application window and its recycling is therefore environmentally and economically favorable and sustainable. Therefore, this study involves the thermal and mechanical behavior of recycled PET after extrusion and 3D printing. The extrusion parameters are optimized by performing a complete physico-chemical and thermal analysis of the obtained filaments and they were compared with commercial virgin and recycled PET. Moreover, the influence of the applied processing conditions on the degree of crystallinity and mechanical properties is investigated. The filaments are then used for FFF, where various printing parameters are altered to obtain the optimum printing conditions (i.e. printing temperature, the build plate temperature, fan cooling and printing directions). The effect of the degree of crystallinity of semi-crystalline PET is investigated via altered printing parameters, showing superior mechanical properties for an increasing degree of crystallinity. To verify the portability of the obtained optimized print parameters, two different FFF printers are used. The use of recycled PET as feedstock for FFF supports the efforts for improving the sustainability of plastics by valorizing PET waste, and prolonging the lifecycle of PET.

COLI; CONCRETE; SILICA	The recycling of waste glass is a major problem for municipalities worldwide. The problem concerns especially colored waste glass which, due to its low recycling rate as result of high level of impurity, has mostly been dumped into landfills. In recent years, a new use was found for it: instead of creating waste, it can be recycled as an additive in building materials. The aim of the study was to evaluate the possibility of manufacturing sustainable and self-cleaning cement mortars with use of commercially available nanomaterials and brown soda-lime waste glass. Mechanical and bactericidal properties of cement mortars containing brown soda-lime waste glass and commercially available nanomaterials (amorphous nanosilica and cement containing nanocrystalline titanium dioxide) were analyzed in terms of waste glass content and the effectiveness of nanomaterials. Quartz sand is replaced with brown waste glass at ratios of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by weight. Study has shown that waste glass can act as a successful replacement for sand (up to 100%) to produce cement mortars while nanosilica is incorporated. Additionally, a positive effect of waste glass aggregate for bactericidal properties of cement mortars was observed.

J	Lam, NN				Nguyen Ngoc Lam			RECYCLING OF AAC WASTE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF AUTOCLAVED AERATED CONCRETE IN VIETNAM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE			English	Article						Autoclaved Aerated Concrete; AAC waste; Compressive strength; Drying shrinkage		The use of recycled materials helps investors to save significantly on production costs, not only from raw material extraction cost but also in the production process. Especially, recycling waste materials helps reducing energy, fuel, and labor costs. Besides, the transportation of recycled materials is also less expensive than the transportation of raw materials. The workload involved in the recycling of materials is minimal but with economic and technical efficiency. Autoclaved aerated concrete (ACC - Autoclaved aerated concrete) has been widely applied in construction works in Vietnam and is considered a reasonable replacement of fired bricks due to lower volume density, and better soundproofing - insulation. The main materials used to make AAC concrete include ground quartz sand, cement, lime, gypsum, aluminum powder, and some other technological additives. However, due to the depletion of natural sand, the partial or complete replacement of natural sand in AAC concrete production plays an important signification. In this study, the AAC waste after the autoclaving process was reused to replace the ground natural sand. The research results show that the AAC waste bricks could be reused with a content of up to 25% to replace the natural sand in AAC fabrication. The main properties of products such as compressive strength, bulk volume density, and drying shrinkage meet the technical requirements of ASTM C1693.

A solution with indirect cooling with subsequent dry adsorption has various advantages in comparison to traditional systems with evaporative coolers. The adsorbents for collection of gaseous hydrocarbons originate from anode manufacturing so that no additives have to be fed into the process. The loaded adsorbents can be recycled into the process avoiding additional waste disposal. Pilot scale tests are necessary in order to determine the most important process variables.

Anodes play an important role in aluminum production. The quality of raw materials can vary based on the source and the process parameters. In spite of the variations in the raw material properties, the industry has to maintain the quality of anodes. In order to manufacture good quality anodes, coke and pitch must interact well with each other. The affinity between these two components depends on good wetting properties, which will lead to good binding of the particles. The main objective of this work is to modify the coke in order to improve its wetting properties using different additives. An FT-IR study was done to identify certain functional groups in non-modified and modified coke as well as in pitch. The wetting tests were carried out using the sessile-drop method to measure the contact angle between cokes and pitch. Based on FT-IR and wettability results, an additive was selected and used for the fabrication of anodes, which were characterized before and after baking. The modification of coke with the selected additive improved the anode properties.

Improving shallow foundations resting on saturated loose sand by a zeolite-cement mixture: A laboratory study	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article						Sand stabilized; Zeolite; Unconfined compression strength; Small-scale 1g test	NATURAL ZEOLITES; BEARING CAPACITY	Improvement operation of sands is carried out frequently by cement together with several other additives. Common additives have high manufacturing cost and negative environmental impact during their manufacturing process and recycling in nature. Zeolite as a mineral substance for cement replacement can improve the strength parameter of a treated sand, without the negative deficiencies of the common additives. In this study, Unconfined Compression Strength (UCS) and small-scale lg model tests were conducted to evaluate the mechanical features of zeolite-treated sand and to study the behavior of shallow foundations resting on zeolite pad, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that the UCS of the cemented sand samples increases when the cement is replaced by zeolite at an optimum proportion of 40% with curing times of 14 and 28 days. Adding this amount of zeolite to cemented sand mixture causes an increase in terms of the improvement rate between 40% and 125% and increases the Bearing Capacity Ratio (BCR) of the strip foundation treated by zeolite pad in the range of 11% to 420%. In addition, zeolite pad leads to a decline in the settlement of the treated strip footing from 16% to 86% in terms of the Settlement Reduction Ratio (SRR). (C) 2018 Sharif University of Technology.

Investigating the effect of metal powder recycling in Electron beam Powder Bed Fusion using process log data	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Electron beam Powder Bed Fusion (E-PBF); Ti-6Al-4V; Inconel 718; Data-driven analysis; Powder recycling	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TI-6AL-4V; REUSE; OXYGEN; RECYCLABILITY; SIMULATION; ALPHA; NI	Recycling metal powders in the Additive Manufacturing (AM) process is an important consideration in affordability with reference to traditional manufacturing. Metal powder recyclability has been studied before with respect to change in chemical composition of powders, effect on mechanical properties of produced parts, effect on flowability of powders and powder morphology. However, these studies involve ex situ characterization of powders after many use cycles. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to understand in situ behavior of recycled powder on the build platform. Our method is based on comprehensive analysis of log file data from various sensors used in the process of printing metal parts in the Arcam Electron Beam Melting (EBM) (R) system. Using rake position data and rake sensor pulse data collected during Arcam builds, we found that Inconel 718 powders exhibit additional powder spreading operations with increased reuse cycles compared to Ti-6Al-4V powders. We substantiate differences found in in situ behavior of Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 718 powders using known sintering behavior of the two powders. The novelty of this work lies in the new approach to understanding powder behavior especially spreadability using in situ log file data that is regularly collected in Arcam EBM (R) builds rather than physical testing of parts and powders post build. In addition to studying powder recyclability, the proposed methodology has potential to be extended generically to monitor powder behavior in AM processes.

Recycled and virgin LDPE as rheology modifiers of lithium lubricating greases: A comparative study	POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE			English	Article							LOW-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; FILM THICKNESS; BEHAVIOR; FLOW; MICROSTRUCTURE; FORMULATIONS; STABILITY; PLASTICS	In this work, a new application for recycled low-density polyethylene (LDPE), as rheology modifier of standard lithium lubricating grease formulations, was studied. The effectiveness of this additive was compared with that achieved with a virgin LDPE. With this aim, both types of polymers were added to the formulation during the manufacturing process of greases, following the same standard protocol, to reinforce the role of the thickening agent, the lithium 12-hidroxystearate. The effect that both lithium soap and LDPE concentrations exert on the rheology of lubricating grease formulations and its relationship with grease microstructure were discussed. Lubricating greases were rheologically characterized through small-amplitude oscillatory shear and viscous flow measurements. In addition to these, scanning electron microscopy observations and mechanical stability tests were also carried out. In all cases, an increase in soap concentration yields higher values of apparent viscosity and linear viscoelasticity functions. On the other hand, the values of the rheological functions obtained for recycled LDPE-based lubricating greases are, in general, higher than those obtained for virgin LDPE-based grease formulations. However, the structural skeleton developed in greases containing recycled LOPE demonstrates less resistance to severe working conditions, showing lower mechanical stability than virgin LDPE-based grease formulations.

Food packaging polyethylene film (PE film) as recycled stretch wraps, recycled low density polyethylene (rLDPE) particles and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin were applied as adhesive for the bonding of veneer to the surface of WPC. No modification additives were used for the manufacture of WPC. It was found that compared with non-veneered WPC, the panels sandwiched with natural veneers greatly improved their properties. The bending strength was improved in 1.9-2.6 and 7.9-10 times across and along veneer fibers respectively for both types of investigated veneer. The highest values of bending strength were observed in WPC panels veneered with rotary-cut birch veneer. However, the water resistance of veneered WPC panels was reduced in comparison with non-veneered. The WPC specimens veneered with both types of veneer using PE film had better mechanical properties and water resistance than those of the specimens made with other two types of adhesives. The veneering of WPC panels enables to significantly improve adhesion properties of these veneered surfaces for their further finishing. In addition, the veneering of WPC panels hides the surface defects and provides a uniform application of different paints, varnishes and films to the surface of such materials. Overlaying WPC panels with wood veneers improves their appearance and properties resulting in eco-friendly value-added products.

Plastic waste originating from EEE (WEEE) is a challenge for recycling due to presence of various hazardous elements (i.e. additives) representing a polluting source for the environment and a risk factor for the human health. Among these, there are those containing brominated flame retardants (BFRs), largely utilized to increase fire resistance, avoiding or delaying the flames, thus allowing to the plastics-based-manufactured-products to respect safety requirements. However, plastics with high BFRs levels cannot be recycled and therefore must be removed from the recycling stream. In a circular economy perspective, it is thus necessary to develop a system able to efficiently separate plastic waste into homogeneous fractions based on the BFRs content. To improve the circularity of plastics, it is thus essential to recover and recycle bromine-free plastics to avoid the loss of available secondary raw materials. The aim of this study was to develop an efficient, reliable and sustainable approach based on hypeispectral imaging (HSI) operating in SWIR range (1000-2500 nm) coupled with chemometrics, specifically addressed to identify plastics containing BFRs. In order to investigate the possibility of reliable sorting, plastic scraps from cathode ray tube with different contents of BFRs were investigated. The concentration of bromine per scrap was preliminary measured by X-ray fluorescence in order to validate the results obtained by HSI. The recyclable low-bromine fraction was successfully identified using the developed strategy based on HSI.

Four basic principles are available to attain an inherently safer design-minimization, substitution, moderation, and simplification. The subject of the current paper is the principle of moderation as it applies to the prevention and mitigation of dust explosions. Moderation can be achieved by processing a material under less severe operating conditions or by processing the material in a less hazardous form. With respect to the latter approach, it may be possible to alter the composition of a dust by admixture of solid inertants, or to increase the dust particle size so as to decrease its reactivity. Additionally, avoidance of the formation of hybrid mixtures of explosible dusts and flammable gases is an application of moderation of the material hazard. Several examples are given for each of the above three forms of moderation. The discussion on admixture of solid inertants includes examples from the following industrial applications: (i) refractory materials manufacturing, (ii) food processing, (iii) power generation, (iv) industrial recycling, and (v) foundry shell mold fabrication. The importance of particle size consideration is explained first from the perspective of engineering tools such as the Dow Fire & Explosion Index, and professional guidance on the definition of a dust and suitable particle sizes for explosibility testing. Industrial examples are then drawn from the following areas: (i) rubber recycling and textile manufacturing, (ii) industrial recycling, (iii) wood processing, (iv) dry additive handling (polyethylene facility), (v) polyethylene production, (vi) carbon block recycling, and (vii) coal mining. The concluding discussion on hybrid mixtures includes brief cases from the process safety literature. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These days, there are tons of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) waste products that are generated around the world. This waste presents a real environmental hazard because PET is not biodegradable. This paper delineates the physical and chemical properties of PET to justify its use as an additive and aggregate replacement in the manufacture of asphalt mixtures. Furthermore, discusses details of PET-modified asphalt mixture by a dry and wet process with sufficient information to better understand the mixture. Several critical matters are investigated, such as asphalt modification to increase resistance to fatigue, rutting deformation, and moisture sensitivity. These results are important for determining the factors that significantly improve pavement mixture characteristics. The findings show that the addition of PET to asphalt mixtures yielded very promising results. PET enhanced the mechanical properties, the durability, and the long-term sustainability of the pavement. Finally, using PET waste as an additive in asphalt mixtures could serve as an environmentally friendly method to dispose of PET waste while simultaneously producing high-quality pavements.

Localized Changes of Stainless Steel Powder Characteristics During Selective Laser Melting Additive Manufacturing	METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; TI-6AL-4V	In laser powder bed additive manufacturing processes, feedstock materials are often recycled after each build. Currently, a knowledge gap exists regarding powder reuse effects on powder size distribution, morphology, and chemistry as a function of part geometry and processing conditions. It was found during selective laser melting (SLM) of 316 stainless steel that a significant amount of (0.100 wtpct) oxygen pickup can occur in molten material (spatter) ejected from the powder bed surface. This value was significantly larger than the oxygen content of the as-received powder feedstock (0.033 wtpct). Furthermore, the powders in the heat-affected-zone regions, adjacent to molten pool, also exhibit oxygen pickup (0.043 wtpct). The oxygen content in unmelted 316L powder was found to vary as a function of its spatial position in the powder bed, relative to the heat source. Interestingly, the volume of melted material (i.e., thin vs thick walls) did not correlate well with the extent of oxygen pickup. Possible mechanisms for oxygen pickup in the powder during SLM, such as adsorption and breakdown of water, oxygen solubility, spatter re-introduction, and solid-state oxide growth, are discussed.

Polishing is performed to improve the surface quality of such sheets and dry machining is typically applied. The problems associated with dry machining are the exhaust heat of machining and treatment of chips. A transition to wet machining is required to solve these problems. In our laboratory, we have developed a wet polishing machine and researched the selection of grinding wheels to develop wet polishing technology for large stainless-steel sheets. In this study, to reduce tool cost and reuse resources, we attempted to manufacture a recycled grinding wheel using snippets of grinding wheel scraps. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) aqueous solution was used as the bonding agent for the recycled grinding wheel to reduce environmental load. To overcome the ease of dissolution of PVA in water, we attempted to improve the water resistance of the PVA aqueous solution by incorporating an organic titanium compound. This is one of our efforts to contribute to sustainable development goals. The results are summarized below. (1) A recycled grinding wheel was fabricated by kneading crushed pieces of grinding wheel scrap with a bonding agent. (2) The maintenance of the shape of the recycled grinding wheel was controlled by the concentration of the bonding agent. (3) The recycled grinding wheel with a PVA bonding agent was vulnerable to water. In contrast, the recycled grinding wheel to which the organic titanium compound was added exhibited improved water resistance. (4) The polishing of stainless-steel sheets using the plain PVA recycled wheel was relatively ineffective, but polishing using the recycled wheel with the titanium additive was comparable to polishing with a new grinding wheel.

Their use in applications is somehow limited by short setting time, brittleness and low water resistance; this calls for the use of additives. Two polymer additives were designed adopting emulsion polymerization, an environmentally friendly solution to make available polymers as water-based latex dispersions. The composites containing 5 wt% of polymer, exhibited better elastic behaviour, with up to twice the toughness of the reference sample and of a sample produced with commercial styrene butadiene rubber latex. Moreover, the additives reduced the apparent porosity, promoted phosphate crystallization, modified the size and shape of crystals, and effectively retarded the reaction, extending working time. The acrylic emulsion developing keto-hydrazide self-crosslinking reaction imparted better properties to the composite, thanks to the synergistic effect with the MPC setting reaction.

CMWW is technogenic aluminum silicate raw material, formed from the particles of undefibred melt (60-70%) and mineral wool fibers (30-40%). 0.3-0.6% of organic binder with phenol and formaldehyde in its composition exists in this material. Objective of the research is to investigate the possibility to use CMWW as an additive for the production of ceramic products, by neutralising phenol and formaldehyde existing in CMWW. Formation masses were prepared by incorporating 10%, 20% and 30% of CMWW additive and burned at various temperatures. It was identified that the amount of 10-30% of CMWW additive influences the following physical and mechanical properties of the ceramic body: lowers drying and firing shrinkage, density, increases compressive strength and water absorption. Investigations carried out show that CMWW waste can be used for the production of ceramic products of various purposes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mechanical Properties of Direct Waste Printing of Polylactic Acid with Universal Pellets Extruder: Comparison to Fused Filament Fabrication on Open-Source Desktop Three-Dimensional Printers	3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						fused granular fabrication; recycling; polylactic acid; tensile properties; distributed recycling	LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS; LARGE-SCALE; EXTRUSION SYSTEM; 3D; POLYMER; DESIGN; REPRAP; DEPOSITION; VIRGIN	Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is the most common and widespread additive manufacturing (AM) technique, but it requires the formation of filament. Fused granular fabrication (FGF), where plastic granules are directly three-dimensional (3D) printed, has become a promising technique for the AM technology. FGF could be a key driver to promote further greening of distributed recycling thanks to the reduced melt solidification steps and elimination of the filament extruder system. However, only large-scale FGF systems have been tested for technical and economic viability of recycling plastic materials. The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of the FFF and FGF techniques in terms of technical and economical dimensions at the desktop 3D printing scale. Recycled and virgin polylactic acid material was studied by using five different types of recycling feedstocks: commercial filament, pellets, distributed filament, distributed pellets, and shredded waste. The results showed that the mechanical properties from the FGF technique using same configurations showed no statistical differences to FFF samples. Nevertheless, the granulometry could have an influence on the reproducibility of the samples, which explains that the critical factor in this technology is to assure the material input in the feeding system. In addition, FGF costs per kg of material were reduced to less than 1 euro/kg compared with more than 20 euro/kg for commercial recycled filament. These results are encouraging to foster FGF printer diffusion among heavy users of 3D printers because of reducing the cost associated to the filament fabrication while ensuring the technical quality. This indicates the possibility of a new type of 3D printing recycled plastic waste that is more likely to drive a circular economy and distributed recycling.

In order to integrate functionality, the use of smart materials like Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloys (SMAs) is a constructive approach. Generally, shape memory alloys are hard to machine and at the same time expensive materials. In this context, additive manufacturing processes like laser metal deposition are reasonable technologies to process these materials as the used powder can be recycled and near net shape geometry can be generated due to a layer-by-layer build-up process. For actuator applications, it might be reasonable to use hybrid systems, meaning just certain sections of a part are made of a shape memory material. One possible example is a NiTi shape memory element on a Ti sheet metal. Due to the varying coefficients of thermal expansion, a dissimilar build-up by means of laser metal deposition without any defects like cracks is challenging. In this paper, an approach that applies preheating is presented to generate SMA elements additively on dissimilar substrates by means of laser metal deposition. Subject of investigations are varying process parameter combinations (e.g., laser power, feed rate, and powder mass flow) and varying preheating temperatures. Based on metallographic analyses, the generated samples are evaluated. Major objective of these analyses are a defect free connection. Additionally, the forming microstructure and the occurring dilution zone are analyzed. In order to characterize the influence of different preheating strategies on the hardness and on the transformations temperatures of the generated parts, the results of hardness measurements and differential scanning calorimetry measurements are presented.

The properties of natural fibre reinforced polymer composites are generally governed by the pre-treated process of fibre and the manufacturing process of the composites. These properties can be tailored for various types of applications by properly selecting suitable fibres, matrices, additives and production methods. Besides, due to the complexity of fibre structures, different mechanical performances of the composites are obtained even with the use of the same fibre types with different matrices. Some critical issues like poor wettability, poor bonding and degradation at the fibre/matrix interface (a hydrophilic and hydrophobic effect) and damage of the fibre during the manufacturing process are the main causes of the reduction of the composites' strength. In this paper, different manufacturing processes and their suitability for natural fibre composites, based on the materials, mechanical and thermal properties of the fibres and matrices are discussed in detail.

Tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris buffer) with added pyridine dicarboxylic acid (PDC) allows the simultaneous detection of sulfate and copper ions, and adding chromate allows the separation of Cl- from the sulfate matrix. When the methods developed are applied to process chemicals, the new analytical technique agrees well with that of current standard techniques within 99.5% (+/- 0.99). The detection limits of these inorganic ions ranged from 0.99 to 2.32 mu g/mL, with relative standard deviations (n = 4) ranging from 0.38% to 10.3%. A method to separate sulfite from sulfate was also developed for gold plating solutions. The optimized method successfully permits determination of sulfite and sulfate with concentrations of 4.65% (+/- 0.43) and 4.32% (+/- 0.37), respectively. These methods can lower production cost, raise production efficiency, and increase the chemical lifetime in the semiconductor manufacturing process through simplified process control, waste reduction, and recycling.

Nowadays, there are several typologies of PCMs, which derive from the wastes of the agricultural industry, which could be used for this kind of design. Each material made of biological waste has a different melting/solidification point and latent heat of fusion/solidification, which means flexibility of design on the heat exchangers by considering the different thermal proprieties of the chosen material. Also, using recycled material from wastes can lead to an overall improvement of the resources and goes hand in hand with the need of today's society to aim more and more at a Circular Economy. The industrial development of this kind of material is limited by its thermal properties, such as poor thermal conductivity both in liquid and solid phases, leading to low heat transfer effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, the bio-based PCMs were integrated into a metallic reticular structure made of copper and aluminium and realised through Indirect-Additive Manufacturing, to improve the overall thermal conductivity of the system and increase the efficiency of the heat transfer. Four compound structures filled each time with four different PCMs were realised and tested, in order to thermally characterise each combination of materials used and choose which one has an overall better thermal behaviour. The results showed how the thermal storage/release was improved by 10% for the copper reticular structure, even if must be considered the tradeoff between better thermal management and the increase of the costs and the weight of the designed heat exchanger.

In the sheet-metal bending manufacturing sector, rigid metallic tools are the most commonly used. This article presents recent findings in the field of no spring ban-metal tools for bending. This type of tool ensures long term performance but has limitations on adaptability to specific geometries and implies high production costs. Over the years, unfilled or reinforced plastic materials have often been considered a lightweight and cost-efficient alternative for replacement of metal mechanical parts. The use of polymeric materials can offer cost and time reduction by including new architectures to allow the integration of additive and subtractive production technologies. Furthermore, unfilled thermoplastics can be recycled at the end of the process. The introduction of equipment combining a metallic support base and a polymeric die insert with sufficient strength is proposed as a solution to reach high performances using non-conventional materials. The polymeric die insert may be produced by 3D printing or other rapid manufacturing technologies and it is rapidly changeable. The modular base allows heavy mechanical loads, while the polymeric die reduces the aesthetical defects of the bent sheets. The study shows that, in air bending, polymeric die inserts allow a process capability which is comparable to the capability reached with metal dies. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Photoreversible Covalent Hydrogels for Soft-Matter Additive Manufacturing	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						Coumarin; hydrogel; reversible covalent; soft-matter additive manufacturing	LIQUID BIODEGRADABLE COPOLYMERS; POLYMER NETWORKS; CROSS-LINKING; REVERSIBLE PHOTODIMERIZATION; COUMARIN CHROMOPHORES; RESPONSIVE HYDROGELS; MOLECULAR DESIGN; TEMPERATURE; POLYESTERS; SOLVENT	Reversible covalent chemistry provides access to robust materials with the ability to be degraded and reformed upon exposure to an appropriate stimulus. Photoresponsive units are attractive for this purpose, as the spatial and temporal application of light is easily controlled. Coumarin derivatives undergo a [2 + 2] cycloaddition upon exposure to long-wave UV irradiation (365 nm), and this process can be reversed using short-wave UV light (254 nm). Therefore, polymers cross-linked by coumarin groups are excellent candidates as reversible covalent gels. In this work, copolymerization of coumarin-containing monomers with the hydrophilic comonomer N,N-dimethylacrylamide yielded water-soluble, linear polymers that could be cured with long-wave UV light into free-standing hydrogels, even in the absence of a photoinitiator. Importantly, the gels were reverted back to soluble copolymers upon short-wave UV irradiation. This process could be cycled, allowing for recycling and remolding of the hydrogel into additional shapes. Further, this hydrogel can be imprinted with patterns through a mask-based, post-gelation photoetching method. Traditional limitations of this technique, such as the requirement for uniform etching in one direction, have been overcome by combining these materials with a soft-matter additive manufacturing methodology. In a representative application of this approach, we printed solid structures in which the interior coumarin-cross-linked gel is surrounded by a nondegradable gel. Upon exposure to short-wave UV irradiation, the coumarin-cross-linked gel was reverted to soluble prepolymers that were washed away to yield hollow hydrogel objects.

Recycling a slurry for reuse in chemical mechanical planarization of tungsten wafer: Effect of chemical adjustments and comparison between static and dynamic experiments	MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Tungsten film; Chemical mechanical polishing; Slurry; Chemical adjustments; Design of experiments	COMPLEXING AGENT; CMP; SURFACTANT; REMOVAL; OXIDE; INHIBITOR; STABILITY; CHEMISTRY; CORROSION; SIZE	Recycling abrasive slurry that has been used in chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is one of the options for reducing the cost of manufacturing microchip processors. We use ultrafiltration which is a method of choice to recycle silica (SiO2)-based slurry. Taking into account that the chemical composition of abrasive slurry plays an important role in tungsten CMP (W-CMP), chemical adjustments have to be made so that the concentrated after used slurry can be reused. In this study, we investigate the effects of chemical additives (iron catalyst, oxalic acid as complexing agent and surfactants as stabilizers) in slurry that has been retreated by ultrafiltration. Experiments are conducted both under static and dynamic conditions and results are compared to better understand the effect of chemical adjustments on the main performances of W-CMP. An optimal chemical adjustment is proposed through a design of experiments evaluation to obtain a concentrated after used and chemically adjust slurry comparable to the operational point of use slurry.

Stability of zinc stearate under alpha irradiation in the manufacturing process of SFR nuclear fuels	RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						MOX fuels; Zinc stearate; Plutonium dioxide; Alpha radiolysis; Gas formation yield; LET effect	DOSES GAMMA-IRRADIATION; POLYETHYLENE; MECHANISMS; RADIOLYSIS; WATER	The manufacture of new fuels for sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) will involve powders derived from recycling existing fuels in order to keep on producing electricity while saving natural resources and reducing the amount of waste produced by spent MOX fuels. Using recycled plutonium in this way will significantly increase the amount of Pu-238, a high energy alpha emitter, in the powders. The process of shaping powders by pressing requires the use of a solid lubricant, zinc stearate, to produce pellets with no defects compliant with the standards. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of alpha radiolysis on this additive and its lubrication properties. Experiments were conducted on samples in contact with PuO2, as well as under external helium ion beam irradiation, in order to define the kinetics of radiolytic gas generation. The yield results relating to the formation of these gases (Go) show that the alpha radiation of plutonium can be simulated using external helium ion beam irradiation. The isotopic composition of plutonium has little impact on the yield. However, an increased yield was globally observed with increasing the mean linear energy transfer (LET). A radiolytic degradation process is proposed.

A modified bitumen with rubber from end-of-life tyres, and a fatty acid amide wax to decrease the manufacturing temperature were used. The process of manufacturing has been carried out in the easiest way. Both mixtures were manufactured at conventional temperature without wax (170 degrees C), and at reduced temperature when the wax was incorporated (150 degrees C). Their mechanical and dynamic performance was compared. The resistance against plastic deformation and the effort that has to be made for the compaction of the mixtures modified with the wax at reduced temperature did not change, but the indirect tensile strength ratio decreased. The stiffness in the mixtures with wax was slightly higher, and there were no significant differences in the resistance to fatigue, although it seemed to decrease when the wax was added.

The study aims to evaluate the changes in the environmental impact when an additive of residual origin, specifically olive pomace (OP), is added following the principles of the Circular Economy. This residue (commonly known as alperujo) was used as a substitute for clay in 1.25, 2.5 and 5 wt%. The environmental impact related to the use of olive pomace in the mixture was estimated using the CML 2000 methodology, yielding improvements of 3.8%, 7.7% and 15.3% for 1.25, 2.5 and 5 wt% OP added, respectively. Optimum addition results are in the range of 1.25 and 2.5 wt% OP. In this way, the reduction of emissions associated with LWA manufacture would be favored without negatively affecting the technological properties of the resulting material.

The effects of the manufacturing conditions, additives, and interfacial modification on the mechanical properties of the composites were investigated. A method of applying newspaper sheet directly to polypropylene without any pretreatment was developed. Experimental results revealed the composites made from this method were twice as strong as the polypropylene without newspaper. Other natural fibers, such as recycled corrugated board, chemical wood pulp, thermomechanical pulp, and cotton pulp were also found to have reinforcing properties for polypropylene. Significant improvement in the mechanical properties has been achieved by blending less than 2% of carbon fiber with the NPF/PP composites.

However, PET is not inert, and therefore, some chemical compounds present in PET could migrate to food or beverages in contact, leading to safety issues. To evaluate the safety of PET samples, the identification of potential migrants is required. In this work, eight PET samples obtained from the Ecuadorian market at different phases of processing were studied using a well-known methodology based on a solvent extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and overall migration test. Several chemical compounds were identified and categorized as lubricants (carboxylic acids with chain length of C12 to C18), plasticizers (triethyl phosphate, diethyl phthalate), thermal degradation products (p-xylene, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid), antioxidant degradation products (from Irgafos 168 and Irganox), and recycling indicator compounds (limonene, benzophenone, alkanes, and aldehydes). Additionally, overall migration experiments were performed in PET bottles, resulting in values lower than the overall migration limit (10 mg/dm(2)); however, the presence of some compounds identified in the samples could be related to contamination during manufacturing or to the use of recycled PET-contaminated flakes. In this context, the results obtained in this study could be of great significance to the safety evaluation of PET samples in Ecuador and would allow analyzing the PET recycling processes and avoiding contamination by PET flakes from nonfood containers.

We compare also the COPGLOW (compacted powder glow discharge analysis) method to the more established XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) technique, in terms of similarity in reported elemental contents. A good match between the two methods was obtained on the surface of the powder particles (using an etching depth of 1 nm). Similar oxide layer thickness, of about 0.5-1 nm, was found on both powders by COPGLOW. Oxidation sensitive elements, such as Cr, were found on the surfaces by both XPS and COPGLOW on both powders. Surface content of Si appears to have decreased during use in selective laser melting. Finally, the two methods did not otherwise reveal any unexpected features in the depth profiles.

Chemically induced repair, adhesion, and recycling of polymers made by inverse vulcanization	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							DYNAMIC COVALENT POLYMERS; ORGANIC SULFUR CHEMISTRY; ELEMENTAL SULFUR; BARRIER HEIGHTS; WASTE; DESULFURIZATION; POLYMERIZATION	Inverse vulcanization is a copolymerization of elemental sulfur and alkenes that provides unique materials with high sulfur content (typically >= 50% sulfur by mass). These polymers contain a dynamic and reactive polysulfide network that creates many opportunities for processing, assembly, and repair that are not possible with traditional plastics, rubbers and thermosets. In this study, we demonstrate that two surfaces of these sulfur polymers can be chemically joined at room temperature through a phosphine or amine-catalyzed exchange of the S-S bonds in the polymer. When the nucleophile is pyridine or triethylamine, we show that S-S metathesis only occurs at room temperature for a sulfur rank > 2-an important discovery for the design of polymers made by inverse vulcanization.

Increasing phosphorus solubility by sintering igneous Dorowa phosphate rock with recycled glass	JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY			English	Article						Phosphate rock; Glass recycling; Sintering; Apatite; P reactivity; Sustainability	SANDY SOILS; FERTILIZER; ZIMBABWE; MIXTURES; PRODUCTS	The lack of low-cost phosphorus fertilizers is a major limitation for food production on Zimbabwe's many smallholdings. A thermally fused magnesium phosphate could be manufactured from the local Dorowa phosphate rock (PR) but would be expensive because of the high cost of required additives and energy. This paper investigates the phosphorus solubility of mixtures of igneous Dorowa PR with either recycled glass or magnesium silicates, before and after thermal alteration at sub-fusion temperatures. The thermal behavior and chemical transformation of Dorowa PR and various additives were investigated by thermo-gravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric analysis and X-ray powder diffraction. Thermal transformation of Dorowa PR + serpentine and Dorowa PR + dunite mixtures resulted in decomposition of calcite, kellyite, lizardite, and chrysotile present in the original mixtures and recrystallization of dehydroxylated metachrysotile to forsterite. The final products of air-cooled Dorowa PR + glass mixtures sintered at 1173 K contained ahrensite (Fe-2(SiO4)), wollastonite (CaSiO3), quartz (SiO2), and hydroxy-fluorapatite. Compared to the unamended Dorowa PR, thermal alteration of Dorowa PR + glass mixtures at 1173 K led to a 62%, 73%, and 44% increase in citric soluble phosphorus when mixed at 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 (Dorowa PR:glass), respectively. This increase in the citric soluble phosphorus content increases the agronomic value of Dorowa PR and is likely the result of substitution of PO43-in hydroxy-fluorapatite by SiO44-and or Mg2+/Na(+)for Ca(2+)and Fe2+.

Alternatively, this study targets the cascading use of these resources within a circular green manufacturing scheme, examining for the first time the utilization of recycled nonwoven textile Polypropylene (PPt), selected from single-use disposable technical-grade garments in the function of matrix-phase; for the development of non-toxic thermoplastic-lignocellulose hybrid sheet materials engineered for building applications. For this purpose two sources of recycled Polypropylene -textile and food packaging- were selected for the comparative analysis between fibrillated and particulate matrices; and wood fibres sourced from furniture manufacturing residual waste were selected as the lignocellulosic disperse-phase, formulated in the ratio of 40/60 wt%, respectively. The hybrid compounds were mechanically micronized, homogenized, and no coupling agent or additives were incorporated. The overall experimental results indicated PPt presented competitive advantages over the particulate polypropylene due to distinctive morphological, microstructural, crystallinity, and chemical variances; which improved the Filler-Matrix interfacial behaviour, increased the hydrophobicity of the blend, as well as facilitated the thermal-processing of the hybrid prototypes during isothermal hot-compression. Consequently, the end-product exhibited peak performance for flexural strength, moisture resistance, and fire-retardant properties, thus, suggesting that disposable technical-grade PP textiles introduce a viable alternative solution for the advancement of multifunctional sustainable building materials manufactured entirely from heterogeneous complex waste mixtures.

Slag, containing 5-20 wt% lead resulting from the thermal recycling of lead from spent batteries, was vitrified with the necessary amount of silica and other additives in order to obtain glasses with desired chemical stability. The most convenient glass was selected and then manufactured and characterised. The influence of composition and temperature on the glass structure and properties were followed using infrared reflectance spectroscopy up to the glass transition temperature, T-g, and electrical conductivity experiments in the solid and molten states. The results were correlated with data obtained from magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR), ultra violet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra and thermal analysis data. The properties compare well with those of the commercially available Drager Austria glass. Therefore the glass produced here could be used for facade material due to its resistance to corrosion.

The foaming operated by the oxidation of SiC, inserted as powder additive, was found to depend on a complex combination of processing temperature, soaking time, tendency of the investigated glasses toward devitrification, and amount of MnO(2), acting as oxidation promoter. Selected combinations led to foams with a good microstructural homogeneity and mechanical strength, suitable for application as aggregates in lightweight concrete.

In this work, cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) obtained by a combined process of enzymatic hydrolysis and grinding (EG-CNFs), grinding and microfluidization (GH-CNFs) or TEMPO-mediated oxidation and grinding (TE-CNFs) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Moreover, CNFs were made into films on which some characterizations including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and UV-Vis transmittance spectroscopy were implemented. Results showed that CNF fibrillation was promoted as times of passes increased in microfluidization, and CNFs pretreated by enzyme possessed shorter length. Crystallinity of CNFs was related to CNF manufacturing methods, while CNF films' transparency was correlated to CNF diameter distributions. Moreover, CNFs were applied with different dosages on recycled and hardwood paper. Lengths of CNFs, strength of CNF network, and pulp properties were critical factors affecting the mechanical strength of CNFs-enhanced paper. GH-CNFs showed better strengthened effect on tensile strength of paper than TE-CNFs and EG-CNFs. The best overall improvement was achieved at GH-CNF10 dosage of 5.0 wt% on hardwood paper. The increment of tensile index, burst index, and folding endurance were 108.32%, 104.65%, and 600%, respectively. This work aims to find out the relationship between production methods and morphologies of CNFs and how the morphological characteristics of CNFs affecting the mechanical performance of paper when they are added as strength additives.

Sille stones, which are building materials used extensively for floor pavement and wall covering in both indoor and outdoor applications, have many artefacts from the Seljuk and Ottoman times until today. In this study, Sille stone powders were used to partially substitute the traditional raw materials to formulate floor tiles based on industrial manufacturing. Sille stone powders to the floor tile composition up to 20 wt% were incorporated to examine their potential effects on the finished product. The additive-induced changes in the structural and technical properties of floor tile samples were characterised in detail using chemical and mineralogical analysis (X-ray diffraction and fluorescence spectrophotometry) and thermal analysis (DTA, TG, and dilatometry test) as well as physical and mechanical tests. According to the results, the usage of Sille stone powders in floor tile compositions decreased the water absorption of the bodies and increased firing shrinkage. The mechanical strength of the bodies improved with the use of Sille stone powders. As a result, the recycling of the Sille stone powders wastes is a promising approach to manufacture traditional ceramic tiles, and their utilization in floor tile compositions could be possible by adjusting the body composition and/or industrial conditions.

Understanding how the virgin powder changes in terms of chemistry and physical properties with reuse cycles provides important information that can be translated into cost-effective practices for managing recycled powder. In this study, we focused on an industrial AM setting, where different numbers of components were printed on each build. A single lot of powder was reused for manufacturing a total of 31 builds using a selective laser melting additive system. The effects of reuse cycles on the characteristics of Ti-6Al-4V extra low interstitial powder were evaluated, during and prior to the printing process, by means of particle size distribution, tap density, flowability, powder morphology, and chemical composition. Additionally, chemical analysis and tensile testing of solid bars in the hot isostatically pressed (HIP) condition were evaluated in relation to powder reuse times. After reusing the powder for 31 times, it was found that the oxygen content increased to a maximum of 0.13 wt.%, whereas nitrogen, aluminum, and vanadium remained stable. The powder exhibited surface coarsening, and although some elongated/irregular particles were observed, mostly spherical powder particles with fewer satellites were present. Flowability improved, and tap density showed a slight decline with reuse times. No detrimental effect was found on the tensile properties of solid material postprocessed using HIP.

J	Zhou, DL; Huang, H; Wang, Y; Yu, JR; Hu, ZM				Zhou, Danling; Huang, Hong; Wang, Yan; Yu, Junrong; Hu, Zuming			Design and synthesis of an amide-containing crosslinked network based on Diels-Alder chemistry for fully recyclable aramid fabric reinforced composites	COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Polymer-matrix composites (PMCs); Recycling; Mechanical properties; Diels-Alder reaction	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FIBER COMPOSITES; POLYMERS; KEVLAR; STEP	Fiber reinforced thermoset composites (FRPCs) have received tremendous attention because of their merits of light weight, high modulus and high strength. However, the efficient recycling of the waste during the manufacturing and service life of FRPCs is still great challenge. This paper reports a newly designed dynamic crosslinked network based on Diels-Alder chemistry as matrix for fully recyclable aramid fabric reinforced composites. The DA network shows good thermomechanical properties owing to the incorporated aromatic amide bonds, and the overall performance can be readily tailored by adjusting the ratio of amide-containing component and flexible aliphatic component. The good reversibility of the DA network and highly efficient recovery of mechanical properties of recycled sample are confirmed. With optimized composition, the DA network exhibits good interfacial strength with aramid fiber that is comparable to that of widely used epoxy resin due to the interfacial hydrogen bonds among amide bonds between fiber and matrix. Moreover, the closed-loop recycling of both matrix and reinforced fabric without any other additive is also demonstrated. This paper presents the first report on recyclable aramid fiber reinforced composites and is expected to provide hints for future development of fully recyclable and high-performance FRPCs.

Several additives have been used to rejuvenate the RAP's aged bitumen. The authors previously studied full recycling of RAP rejuvenated with waste cooking oil (WCO). The asphalt concrete (AC) manufactured revealed good mechanical behaviour except for rutting resistance. Therefore, they decided to also include in the asphalt mixtures low density polyethylene (LDPE) from urban waste as a low-cost polymer to improve that weak point and verify if this technique was feasible and with potential as a pavement material. A laboratory plan was conceived to evaluate the mechanical performance of two rejuvenated ACs with WCO and LDPE. Stiffness, water sensitivity, resistance to rutting and fatigue cracking were evaluated. The results showed that, despite some empirical parameters usually indicated in current specifications not being met, the performance of the studied asphalt mixtures was adequate and, thus, there are good expectations about the future use of these solutions in real pavements, particularly for low and intermediate traffic levels. Based on a global analysis of the performance observed, the main conclusion was that full recycling of AC with WCO and LDPE is feasible, and the score obtained was higher than that of a conventional AC used for comparison.

J	Cheng, YC; Chai, C; Liang, CY; Chen, Y				Cheng, Yongchun; Chai, Chao; Liang, Chunyu; Chen, Yu			Mechanical Performance of Warm-Mixed Porous Asphalt Mixture with Steel Slag and Crumb-Rubber-SBS Modified Bitumen for Seasonal Frozen Regions	MATERIALS			English	Article						porous asphalt mixture; crumb-rubber-SBS modified bitumen; warm mix asphalt; steel slag; mechanical performance	OXYGEN FURNACE SLAG; RECYCLED CONCRETE; BINDERS; WAX; TECHNOLOGY; ADDITIVES; AGGREGATE; SURFACE	In this paper, the performance of a warm-mixed porous asphalt mixture (PAM) with steel slag as aggregate and crumb-rubber-SBS (styrene-butadiene-styrene) modified bitumen as a binder was studied. Two kinds of warming additives were used, namely ethylene bis stearic acid amide (EBS) and stearic acid amide (SA). The mixtures were investigated for their permeability, Marshall stability, low-temperature crack resistance, and underwent a rutting test, water sensitivity evaluation and Cantabro particle loss test. Then, the viscoelastic and dynamic characteristics of the mixtures were also analyzed. The results showed that the addition of the warming additives allowed the decrease of the manufacturing temperature by 10 degrees C. Thus, the addition of warming additives significantly improves the low-temperature crack resistance and slightly reduces the water sensitivity, weakly increases the permeability, and has little effect on the resilient modulus. Since the addition of SA significantly improves the low-temperature crack resistance and rutting resistance of the PAM, SA is therefore recommended for pavement engineering in seasonal frozen regions.

Therefore, the study developed proposes the use of Ornamental Rock Sawdust Waste (RSRO) for the production of interlocking concrete pieces, used in paving, that meet current legislation, encouraging the adoption of the material in its production process. The research used the recycled raw material in the partial replacement of the conventional binder, in the contents of 0, 4, 8, and 12% by mass, evaluating the behavior through the use of additives in two different cures: by immersion and spraying. The use of RSRO had an increase in strength for the mixes with 8 and 12% of substitution, for those that were subjected to immersion and no additives were used, for the rest, there was a slight decrease, however, it maintained the resistance determined by the standard. The use of the additive with the reduction of water had lower results than those who did not use it. The different cures achieved similar results, but the additive mixes decayed too much for spraying.

Such particles are the most compact, packed in a certain volume and provide "fluidity" of the powder composition in the material supply systems with the least resistance. The wide use of the method of metal waste recycling into powders for their reuse and application in additive technologies is constrained by the lack of scientific and technical literature complete information on the impact of the original composition, modes and environment on the powder properties and practical application technologies. Therefore, comprehensive theoretical and practical researches are required to develop technologies for the reuse of electro-erosion powders and to estimate the effectiveness of their use. The aim of the work was to study the wear resistance of additive product samples, obtained from cobalt-chromium electro-erosion powder. The wear resistance of the samples was studied on a high-temperature tribometer manufactured by CCM tools. The friction coefficient (initial, maximum and average) is determined on the basis of the wear resistance assessment. The wear coefficient value of the statistical partner and the wear coefficient of the electric spark coating were also identified. The visual image of the wear trace and the wear groove profile of the electro-spark coating are shown.	[Ageev, E. V.; Altukhov, A. Yu; Ageeva, E.

PLAP materials have been thermally disengaged at 550 degrees C for 20 min in an argon gas created inert atmosphere to recycle into solid Al and graphitic carbon. In a different route, in the presence of gaseous N-2 at 600 degrees C for 1h, the PLAP materials are degraded into bio-oil. A new technique to produce powdered materials from the ductile metal (Al) has been introduced in this study. In this technique, recycled Al and C from the first route at 550 degrees C, undergoes mechanical milling at cryogenic temperature (-196 degrees C) created by liquid N-2. The translatory high energy ball milling process varied for 2, 4, 6, and 8 cycles (time: 17, 29, 41, and 53 min respectively). As the milling process is extensively high impact loaded at a very low temperature, the foil-like Al recycled from the packaging waste transforms into smaller particles within a very short time (20 min). Upon further milling (41 min), the microparticles (particle size below 100 mu m) of Al can be observed. The microparticles received from the cryo-mill are characterized to investigate the particle size, morphology, crystallographic structure, thermal behavior, chemical state, and dispersibility in different liquid media. Flake shaped, and microsized carbonaceous Al microparticles are contamination-free and thermally stable and can be useful in the fields of additive manufacturing. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Development of the life cycle inventory of masonry mortar made of natural and recycled aggregates	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Construction and demolition waste; Life cycle inventory; Life cycle assessment; Masonry mortar; Recycled aggregate	ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT ASSESSMENT; BUILDING-MATERIALS; CONVENTIONAL CONCRETE; CONSTRUCTION; LCA; WASTE; PRODUCTS; ROAD	The use of recycled fine aggregate from construction and demolition waste as a replacement for natural fine aggregate in the manufacture of masonry mortar represents an environmental benefit that must be quantified. The life cycle assessment is a procedure that allows to know the environmental impacts associated with a product throughout its life cycle; for that purpose, it incorporates a series of phases of which inventory analysis is one of the most important as it directly influences its overall quality. The main aim of this study has been to develop the life cycle inventory of masonry mortars made of natural fine aggregate and recycled fine aggregate in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, and being the system subject of study from cradle to gate level, thus boundaries included the production of the mortar components (natural fine aggregate, recycled fine aggregate, filler, cement and additive) and the production of masonry mortar in mortar plant. For the inventory development, production data given by the producers, Ecoinvent v.2.2 database and Environmental Product Declaration were used as data source. According to the results obtained, thanks to this study the main inputs regarding energy and raw material consumption and the main outputs (products, coproducts, waste and emissions) have been identified and quantified, linked to the masonry mortar life cycle and found inside the system boundaries considered. In a future research, the inventory developed shall allow to assess and compare the environmental impacts related to the production of masonry mortars made of natural fine aggregate and recycled fine aggregate.

J	Horowitz, N; Frago, J; Mu, DY				Horowitz, Naomi; Frago, Jessica; Mu, Dongyan			Life cycle assessment of bottled water: A case study of Green2O products	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This study conducted a full life cycle analysis of bottled water on four types of bottles: ENSO, PLA (corn based), recycled PET, and regular (petroleum based) PET, to discern which bottle material is more beneficial to use in terms of environmental impacts. PET bottles are the conventional bottles used that are not biodegradable and accumulate in landfills. PLA corn based bottles are derived from an organic substance and are degradable under certain environmental conditions. Recycled PET bottles are purified PET bottles that were disposed of and are used in a closed loop system. An ENSO bottle contains a special additive which is designed to help the plastic bottle degrade after disposed of in a landfill. The results showed that of all fourteen impact categories examined, the recycled PET and ENSO bottles were generally better than the PLA and regular PET bottles; however, the ENSO had the highest impacts in the categories of global warming and respiratory organics, and the recycled PET had the highest impact in the eutrophication category. The life cycle stages that were found to have the highest environmental impacts were the bottle manufacturing stage and the bottled water distribution to storage stage. Analysis of the mixed bottle material based on recycled PET resin and regular PET resin was discussed as well, in which key impact categories were identified. The PLA bottle contained extremely low impacts in the carcinogens, respiratory organics and global warming categories, yet it still contained the highest impacts in seven of the fourteen categories. Overall, the results demonstrate that the usage of more sustainable bottles, such as biodegradable ENSO bottles and recycled PET bottles, appears to be a viable option for decreasing impacts of the bottled water industry on the environment.

J	Gu, H; Bashir, Z; Yang, LT				Gu, Hao; Bashir, Zahir; Yang, Lanti			The re-usability of heat-exposed poly (ethylene terephthalate) powder for laser sintering	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Selective laser sintering; Powder; PET; Recycling	POLYAMIDE; POLY(ETHYLENE-TEREPHTHALATE); PEEK; PET	Selective laser sintering, also called laser sintering (LS), is an additive manufacturing process that requires micronized plastic powder. Recently, we showed poly (ethylene terephthalate (PET) powder is a suitable material for LS, with a comparable printing performance as the current front-runner, polyamide 12 (PA12). However, the LS process, by its nature, leaves unused powder that has been exposed to heat for prolonged time, and this powder may not be fully re-usable due to degradation. In this work, the re-use potential of heat-exposed PET powder is established. This is a matter of crucial importance as powders suitable for LS are very expensive, and the powder left after a building episode has to be re-used. Heat-exposed PA12 has to be blended or refreshed with virgin powder, to avoid printing defects. In contrast, heat-exposed PET powder, after 96 h at 210 degrees C, could be used, without refreshing with a portion of virgin powder. The printed articles from heat-exposed powders were as good as those from the fresh powder. There was no cross-linking and there was only a minor increase in the molecular weight of the powder after 96 h, at 210 degrees C.

Warm mix asphalt (WMA) technology helps to decrease manufacturing temperature in traditional hot mix asphalts (HMA), which reduces emissions that are detrimental to the environment. For the case of asphalt pavements, WMA technology, which uses recycled materials such as blast furnace slag (BFS), this could be an interesting alternative technique. Reutilizing these types of industrial waste materials for roadway project constructions could help to minimize negative impacts on the environment. In this study, the coarse fraction of natural aggregate in a control HMA was replaced with BFS. Additionally, a chemical additive was used to lower mixing temperature by 30 degrees C, and thus manufacture WMA. Marshall, indirect tensile strength, resilient modulus and permanent deformation tests were carried out. This additive helps to reduce air void content, reduces mixing and compacting temperatures and increases asphalt stiffness. Studied WMA that has a 12.5% substitution of coarse natural aggregate fraction with BFS, results in a significant increase in stiffness (under monotonic and cyclic loads), as well as an increase in resistance to moisture damage and to permanent deformations, when compared to control HMA.

Therefore, investigations into the change in powder characteristics and related microstructure defects, tensile properties are needed. In this paper, the influence of powder re-using time on Selective Laser Melting-based fabrication of CoCrW alloy was studied. The spattering process and the powder pollution caused by spatter particles were observed via high-speed imaging. The densification mechanism and the evolution of the microstructure of the CoCrW printed components were analyzed. The mechanical properties of the components printed using powders polluted at a varying degree by the spatter were tested at different stages of the life cycle. Results indicate that the Selective Laser Melting-generated spatter particles look more complex than the virgin powder particles. Compared with laser irradiating on the substrate, much more spatter escaped from the molten pool as the laser irradiated on the powder; the powder showed a trend towards increased particle size diameter through repeated recycling; residual pores distribution state and size applied with the various powder usage times were analyzed, pores with the average size of 300 mu m could be achieved when powder recycled for the sixth time. At last, it is concluded that the spatter severely affects the mechanical properties of the fabricated components, as the tensile strength, yield strength and elongation of CoCrW alloy was reduced from 1284 MPa, 855 MPa and 11.15% to 874 MPa, 689 MPa and 3.82%, respectively. This gives insights into the influence of powder features on Selective Laser Melting-fabricated components and into improvement in stability of Selective Laser Melting manufacturing processes by controlling spatter formation.

Monitoring the petroleum bitumen characteristics changes during their interaction with the polymers	OIL AND GAS ENGINEERING (OGE-2017)	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Oil and Gas Engineering (OGE) Conference	APR 24, 2017	Omsk, RUSSIA	Gazprom Neft Co		petroleum bitumen; thermoplastic elastomer; polyethylene; adhesive additive	POLYETHYLENE	The subject of the study is the characteristics (penetration, softening temperature, ductility and elasticity) of a road binder based on petroleum bitumen. The work purpose is to monitor the changes in the characteristics of petroleum bitumen when it interacting with polymers: thermoplastic elastomer, low-density polyethylene, including the adhesive additive presence. To carry out the research a special laboratory facility was designed and manufactured with two blade mixers providing intensive turbulent mixing and the possibility to effect on the transition process of combining the components in a polymer-bitumen binder. To construct a mathematical model of the polymer-bitumen binder characteristics dependence from the composition, methods of statistical experiments planning were used. The possibility of the expensive thermoplastic elastomers replacement with polyethylene is established while maintaining acceptable polymer-bitumen binder quality parameters. The obtained results are proposed for use in road construction. They allow to reduce the roads construction cost with solving the problem of recycling long-term waste packaging from polyethylene.

With numerous efforts devoted to modification of commercially available thermoplastic FDM filaments, developing printing polymeric materials with new chemical design that could intrinsically improve interlayer adhesion, especially combined with other benefits, is in high demand. Herein, we developed a polyurea vitrimer with heat-driven malleability, which is printed to different 3D geometries using FDM. Significantly improved interlayer adhesion was observed by post-annealing the printed samples close to its topology-freezing transition temperature upon which fast associative dynamic covalent bonds exchange reaction occurs. Isotropic mechanical properties were achieved as demonstrated with printed tensile samples with different infill directions. The printed materials could be fully recycled for five generations with retained mechanical properties. Furthermore, the mechanical performance of the printed sample could also be repaired after damage.

The additive confined on the fabric surface allowed it to be reactive in the heating stage of the composite production right at the interface between fibres and matrix. The resulting composites were tensile tested comparing the data with the neat matrices and the composites with untreated fabric. A discussion to explain the mechanical results taking in consideration the density, porosity and crystallinity as well as exploiting some micro-mechanical models is presented.

It serves as a suspending medium and a swelling agent for the fibres, dispersing and forming them into a uniform sheet during the initial stage of the papermaking process. It also serves as the solvent for a variety of chemicals and additives to adjust product quality. Water reclamation has always been a momentous task in the pulp and paper (P&P) industry. The main driving forces for the adoption of process water and wastewater treatment technologies are environmental regulations, costs of wastewater discharge and the high cost of freshwater. Recent developments have made it possible to not only reduce water consumption and environmental impacts, but also to recover treated water and valuable compounds such as fibres, making water recycling technologies cost-efficient. Thus, the economic viability of these technologies has played an important role in their application. The technologies applied, the level of reduction in water consumption and the extent of water recycling are different for each mill, since the quality of whitewater and wastewater varies depending on the raw materials and products. The maintenance of the balance between partial equilibria of process variables such as water flowrates, pulp consistency, physiochemical, thermal and microbiological properties through water management is important for maintaining efficient water use and lowering the need for consumption of additional fresh water.

Furthermore, it aims to improve the properties of clay bricks by using naturally available materials and also to develop an innovative way of recycling the waste resulting from the brick firing process. Olive pomace bottom ash was added to clay with multiple proportions (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) by weight. Bricks were molded by compression at 6.5 MPa, using a hydraulic brick press machine, and fired in an industrial scale furnace. The physicochemical, mineral, and geotechnical properties of raw materials were identified to study raw materials' effect on the final fired products' performance. The quality of fired specimens was determined by bulk density, linear shrinkage, water absorption, porosity, compressive strength, and thermal conductivity. In fact, samples with 5% olive pomace ash represent the highest compressive strength level, 11.5 MPa, compared to 9.65 MPa of reference samples. On the other hand, additions up to 20% increase the brick sample's porosity from 18.28% to 34% for the reference mixture and the brick incorporated with 20% of additive, respectively, and decrease the brick's bulk density from 1522 kg/m(3) to 1431 kg/m(3) for the reference mixture and the brick incorporated with 20% of additive, respectively. The incorporation of ash also improves the thermal conductivity of brick specimens. Expressly, thermal conductivity went from 0.41 W/m.K to 0.33 W/m.K for the reference mixture and the brick incorporated with 20% of additive, respectively, showing 37% of gain in thermal insulating properties of brick. Unfortunately, the capillary water absorption coefficient increases to 28% when 20% of additive is incorporated, which is not desired in the properties of construction materials. ASTMC67-07a standards: 2003, recommend water absorption level less than 17% for bricks with moderate weathering resistance. It was concluded that the addition of olive pomace bottom ash should not exceed 10% since it can be helpful in fired clay brick production based on standards requirements, leading to remarkable ecological gains without a loss of brick's performances.

Aluminum is a great material to manufacture metallic pigment due to the lamellar format of particles. The lamellar morphology increases the resistant of penetration creating a protection to the surface. The covering morphology of aluminum powder is known as "flake". In addition, it is possible to recycle aluminum to produce pigment with high quality because of its capacity of recycling repeatedly. This work will focus on the development of metallic pigment using aluminum scrap by high energy milling. The use of reduced particles improves the ability of abrasion resistance, hardness and covering. The ideal morphology was reached by the control of milling parameters such as rotation and time of milling. The flake was produced by decreasing the parameters in high energy mill. The evolution of the particles was achieved in planetary milling using ethil alcohol 95% as additive. The additive was responsible to control the cold fusion in milling process. The material morphology and the size reduction in the different parameters of process were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The model of SEM was Tescan microscope a VEGA 3 LMU. The results indicate that the pigment was diluted in resin epoxy and applied in surface to check its adherence and homogeneity.

Bricks containing zinc extraction residue (5%-40%) were prepared and sintered at 900 degrees C, 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. Fired brick specimens were characterized in terms of environmental risk, physical and mechanical properties. Sintered bricks at 1100 degrees C exhibited the different behaviors than others due to the vitrification phenomenon. Compared to the sintering temperatures, the compressive strength (39.22 MPa) and bulk density (2.31 g/cm(3)) of samples with 40% ZER at 1100 degrees C were higher than specimens at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, while the porosity (3.1%) and water absorption (1.3%) values were lower. The solubility values of all metals, except for Pb, for all fired bricks with ZER at 900 degrees C, 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C are below the limit values according to TCLP standard. However, Pb could only be immobilized (<5 ppm) in ceramic body at 1100 degrees C for all additive rates. Pb release is within acceptable limits up to 10% (3.528 ppm) and 30% (4.989 ppm) ZER addition at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, respectively. Experimental findings demonstrate that reuse of zinc extraction residue in the brick and ceramic manufacturing contributes to the improvement of product properties and immobilization of heavy metals.

Resilient Response and Permanent Strain of Subgrade Soil Stabilized with Byproduct Recycled Steel and Cementitious Materials	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; GRANULAR-MATERIALS; MODULUS; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR	Steel manufacturing factories usually dump byproduct recycled steel randomly in open areas, creating environmental hazards. Using such materials in highway construction could be a solution to the environmental hazards generated from their disposal. A combined method of physical and chemical stabilization was used in this study to investigate the value of using mill scale (MS) and cementitious materials in improving the strength and deformation properties of subgrade soil. The results showed that MS additives effectively reduced plasticity and increased maximum dry unit weight, unconfined compression strength (UCS), and California bearing ratio (CBR). Subgrade soil with 20% MS was treated with cement and lime to obtain a strength value of 1.7 MPa (after 7 days of curing) for subbase application. A repeated load triaxial (RLT) device was used to perform resilient modulus (MR) and permanent deformation tests in order to evaluate the response of laboratory-molded stabilized specimens under cyclic loading in accordance with a standard testing procedure. Study findings are explained through a microstructural analysis that used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) supplied with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). The test results showed that, in addition to solving the MS disposal problem, the use of MS as an additive had a favorable influence on the geotechnical properties of the soil.

Tailings of granitic composition from Barruecopardo, of calc-silicate wastes from Morille, and of schists and quartz from Panasqueira, were used as raw materials. The addition of CaCO3 and NaCO3 was necessary for the manufacture of the glass. Samples were characterised by XRF, XRD, HSM and DTA-TG. Furthermore, the expansion coefficient, Vickers microhardness and leaching properties were measured. The results show that all the tungsten mine tailings used were suitable for the manufacture of commercial glass, with the addition of calcium and soda. The calc-silicate tailing needs less additive content to produce a glass. Also, they present lower workability temperatures and higher durability. Glasses obtained from all the tested tailings retain the potentially toxic elements in their structure and prevents the environmental pollution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However when professionals from different engineering backgrounds and different expertise face the challenge of "professional-recycling" the teaching approach is different. It must be intended to change the focus of engineers and technicians with years of experience in order to acquire significant knowledge of new additive technologies. This work depicts the learning approach adopted by a spanish engineering Centre by showing the different backgrounds of these "newcomers" of rapid technologies and Computer aided engineeering by highlighting the evolution, from the initial profile and career of the student, to the final project developed as a result of the new acquired knowledge. A number of projects are also illustrated, based on the ability of the student to grasp the concepts of Rapid technologies and translate them to new product features that break or widen their paradigm of what design for manufacturing is about.

This black toner is a polymer composite comprised of a styrene-based copolymer, carbon black and other additives. The mechanical properties of toners are specifically designed to allow attrition to 10-20 mu m particles. Thus the bulk mechanical properties are not desirable for load bearing applications typical of consumer plastics. Reactive and non-reactive blending oftener with other polymers have been used to enhance the mechanical properties. The blends and alloys produced exhibit a transition from brittle to ductile behavior as exhibited by impact energy data. Thus a family of polymeric systems of variable properties versus cost compromise can be created.

In order to unlock the potentials of 3D printing beyond prototyping purposes, continuous fiber-embedded fused filament fabrication (FFF) as a process for composite production has gained importance. This study focuses on the potential use of recycled, glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (rPETG) as a matrix material in continuous fiber additive manufacturing of composites. First, the characteristics of rPETG were compared with those of non-recycled PETG in terms of molecular weight as well as rheological, thermal, and mechanical properties. Then, rPETG and PETG composites containing 25% continuous carbon filament (CCF) fibers (CCFs) were printed using a co-extrusion-type FFF printer. Their tensile and flexural properties were characterized. It was found that the tensile properties of rPETG-based composites were lower than those of PET-based composites, but their flexural properties were nearly the same. The thermodynamic work of adhesion approach was applied to understand the interfacial interactions between the matrix and CFF. It was found that the thermodynamic adhesion between rPETG/CFF was higher than that of PETG/CFF. Additionally, SEM-SE images obtained from the fracture surfaces of the samples supported the findings by showing that the adhesion between rPETG and CF was superior to that between PETG and CF. Thus, this study demonstrated that recycled PETG can be used as a possible matrix material for 3D-printed CCF composites, thus highlighting the ability of recycled plastics to be converted into circular products with high added value.

Automotive shredded residue (ASR) waste plastics are difficult to recycle and hence contribute significantly to environmental problems. In this study, a sustainable approach to fabricate protective nanoscale TiN thin film on a metal surface by using automotive waste plastics as titanium and carbon sources is investigated. The synthesis of nanoscale thin film of titanium nitride on steel substrate was carried out by using carbothermal reduction and nitridation reaction in a nitrogen atmosphere. The formation of TiN nanofilm on steel substrate was confirmed by XPS, XRD, and EDS techniques. The TiN film was characterized by HRTEM, and thickness was found to be in the range of 18 nm. The uniform and highly crystalline TiN thin film could provide good oxidation resistance to steel substrate. This innovative approach of using automotive waste plastics as titanium and reductant source for fabricating TiN film on metal could be an alternative to conventional techniques. This novel route reduces the manufacturing cost and also provides a sustainable recycling solution for automotive waste plastic.

The function of the burnable poison fuel is to control the neutron population in the reactor core during its startup and the beginning of the fuel burning cycle to extend the use of the fuel. The implementation of UO2-Gd2O3 poisoned fuel in Brazil has been proposed according to the future requirements established for the Angra-2 nuclear power plant. The UO2 powder used is produced from the Ammonium Uranyl Carbonate (AUC). The incorporation of Gd2O3 powder directly into the AUC-derived UO2 powder by dry mechanical blending is the most attractive process, because of its simplicity. Nevertheless, processing by this method leads to difficulties while obtaining sintered pellets with the minimum required density. The cause of the low densities is the bad sintering behavior of the UO2-Gd2O3 mixed fuel, which shows a blockage in the sintering process that hinders the densification. This effect has been overcome by microdoping of the fuel with small quantities of aluminum. The process for manufacturing the fuel inevitably generates uranium-rich scraps from various sources. This residue is reincorporated into the production process in the form of U3O8 powder additions. The addition of U3O8 also hinders densification in sintering. This study was carried out to investigate the influence of both aluminum and U3O8 additives on the density of fuel pellets after sintering. As the effects of these additives are counterposed, this work studied the combined effect thereof, seeking to find an applicable composition for the production process. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of aluminum, in the form of Al(OH)(3), as an additive to promote increase in the densification of the (U, Gd) O-2 pellets during sintering, even with high additions of U3O8 recycled from the manufacturing process.

However, material aging and part performance stability are still challenges to face in LS irrespective of protective atmosphere. Consequently, this work focuses on the essence of these problems and investigations on systematical mechanism of PA-12 aging and its micro-structural evolution during IS. The results show that the mechanism mainly has two opposite aspects concerning the material processability. On one hand, analogous Brill transition of peak merging, which is discovered for the first time in the powder aging process of LS PA-12 material, leads to a higher one set melting temperature of the aged powder and broadens the sintering window more than 1 degrees C after 3 recycling. On the other, the existence of solid-state and melt-state polycondensation, which is proved by XPS and rheological measurements, induces the higher temperature nucleation for the aged powder and the crystallization postponement for aged LS parts detected in DSC. The effect of solid-state polycondensation reduces the crystallinity of the powder by 6% after 3 recycling. This mechanism is of the guiding significance for powder stability improvement and consistent control of component properties next.

Aluminum trihydroxide (ATH) was used as a fire retardant additive and mixed with the fibers to manufacture experimental MDF panels using wet process. Phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin in liquid, 2% based on oven dry weight of fibers, was used along with 0%, 10%, 15% and 20% of ATH. The flame retardant test was done using the limiting oxygen index (LOI) test. The other properties investigated include internal bond strength, thickness swelling and water absorption. The results showed that ATH loading increased as the LOI of MDF increased. This demonstrated that ATH could improved the fire retardant property of MDF at sufficient loading. An increase in concentration of ATH showed an increase in the 113 values of MDF made without resin. MDF panels made without resin showed a progressive increase in internal bond as the composition of recycled old corrugated containers fiber increased. Addition of resin improved internal bond strength and reduced thickness swelling, and water absorption. Thickness swelling of panel increased as the composition of recycled old corrugated containers fiber increased. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) showed that there is indication of ATH and resin filling the void space in between fibers. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Keating, S; Oxman, N				Keating, Steven; Oxman, Neri			Compound fabrication: A multi-functional robotic platform for digital design and fabrication	ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Digital fabrication; Compound fabrication; 3D printing; Robotic milling; Robotic arm; Rapid prototyping		Supporting various applications of digital fabrication and manufacturing, the industrial robot is typically assigned repetitive tasks for specific pre-programmed and singular applications. We propose a novel approach for robotic fabrication and manufacturing entitled Compound Fabrication, supporting multi-functional and multi-material processes. This approach combines the major manufacturing technologies including additive, formative and subtractive fabrication, as well as their parallel integration. A 6-axis robotic arm, repurposed as an integrated 3D printing, milling and sculpting platform, enables shifting between fabrication modes and across scales using different end effectors. Promoting an integrated approach to robotic fabrication, novel combination processes are demonstrated including 3D printing and milling fabrication composites. In addition, novel robotic fabrication processes are developed and evaluated, such as multi-axis plastic 3D printing, direct recycling 3D printing, and embedded printing. The benefits and limitations of the Compound Fabrication approach and its experimental platform are reviewed and discussed. Finally, contemplation regarding the future of multi-functional robotic fabrication is offered, in the context of the experiments reviewed and demonstrated in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Applications of ozone technologies to control pollution in full-scale industrial wastewater treatment plants in the areas of recycling marine aquaria, electroplating wastes, electronic chip manufacture, textiles, and petroleum refineries, are discussed. The rising acceptance of ozone as a replacement bleaching agent for paper pulp to eliminate the discharge of halogenated effluents from pulp bleaching plants also is traced. Newer applications for ozone in treating rubber additive wastewaters, landfill leachates, and detergents in municipal wastewaters are summarized briefly. The combination of ozone oxidation followed by biological treatment has been installed full-scale at a large German industrial chemical complex. Ozone coupled with ultraviolet radiation and/or hydrogen peroxide (advanced oxidation) is being utilized to destroy organic contaminants in groundwaters at munitions manufacturing plants and at Superfund sites (hazardous wastes). Ozone followed by activated carbon adsorption removes color and organics cost-effectively from North African phosphoric acid.

Recycling of polymer waste with SiC/Al2O3 reinforcement for rapid tooling applications	MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Recycled polymer; HDPE; FDM; Mechanical properties	CONCRETE; COMPOSITES	In this research work an effort has been made to develop in house feed stock filament wire made up of recycled polymer waste as base matrix with SiC/Al2O3 reinforcement for sustainable development. The process starts with collection of waste polymer (high density polyethylene (HDPE) as a case study) from local industry. After manual segregation of contamination from waste polymer, initially rheological and thermal properties like: melt flow index (MFI), melting temperature, decomposition and enthalpy of the base polymer as well as reinforced with ceramic particle in different proportions, were tested. Further based upon thermal properties different proportions of HDPE, SiC and Al2O3 were prepared by using mini compounder (twin screw extruder) to ensure uniform dispersion. After this single screw extruder was used to prepare filament wire of uniform diameter for fused deposition modelling (FDM) setup. The filament wire so prepared was tested for its tensile properties by using universal testing machine (UTM) and various mechanical properties like: peak strength, break strength, percentage elongation and peak load etc. were established. Finally scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were obtained to understand the distribution of ceramic particles in filament wire. This study highlights the detailed procedure for managing the polymer waste with novel method by using recycled polymer as rapid tooling. This will enhance the sustainability and also helps to develop low cost, in-house open source FDM setup, rapid tooling (as ceramic particles in filament wire will enhance surface properties).

Recycling glass from the municipal solid waste stream in order to manufacture new glass products is limited due to high costs, impurities, and mixed color. Although colorless waste glass has been recycled effectively, colored waste glass with its low recycling rate, has mostly been dumped into landfills. Due to its high level of impurity, colored glass cannot be processed easily. A new use was found for it, instead of creating waste: an additive in building materials. In this study, the self-cleaning properties and strength development characteristics of mortar containing waste glass and nanomaterials (nanosilica - nSiO(2) and titanium dioxide - TiO2) are analyzed in terms of waste glass content and the effectiveness of commercially available nanomaterials. Quartz sand is replaced with brown waste glass at ratios of 25%, 50% and 100% by weight. The photodegradation of the rhodamine B test has been conducted to analyze the effect of titanium dioxide, nanosilica and waste glass presence in the cement mortar for its potential application in self-cleaning facades. Studies have shown that waste glass can act as a successful replacement for sand, especially when mixed partially with sand. Additionally, a positive influence of nanomaterials on the self-cleaning and mechanical properties was noted. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mele, M; Campana, G; Fumelli, G				Mele, Mattia; Campana, Giampaolo; Fumelli, Giovanni			Environmental impact assessment of Arburg plastic freeforming additive manufacturing	SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Life cycle assessment; Arburg plastic freeforming; Life cycle thinking	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; OPTIMIZATION; DEPOSITION; FRAMEWORK; POWDER	Arburg Plastic Freeforming (APF) is an advanced and original Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology that melts granulate thermoplastics through a heated reciprocating screw and deposits droplets layer-by layer to build three-dimensional objects. The process requires technological decisions, the environmental repercussions of which are still unexplored. This study provides a parametric cradle-to-gate life-cycle assessment of the APF process based on the Ecoinvent dataset and the ReCiPe method. An application is presented to highlight the influence of different materials, process parameters and use scenarios. The findings show that printer utilisation is the most significant factor for all environmental impacts. Particularly, the machine production phase accounts for 67% of total impacts on human health, 35% on ecosystem quality and 85% on resource scarcity. The impact of electrical consumption on Global Warming Potential (GWP) makes the 3D printing phase crucial to human health (30%) and ecosystem quality (61%). Since both machine and 3D printing impacts are allocated on the building time, the influence of different materials and process parameters leads to considerable differences in impact indicators. Particularly, the different drop-aspect ratio determines a higher environmental impact of some biopolymers in comparison to oil-derived plastics. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the recycling of machine components and disposable plate significantly affects human health. Reusing building plates for more than one print job can bring additional benefits to resource scarcity. The proposed parametric framework can be effectively applied to assess the environmental impacts of any Arburg Plastic Freeforming production whose total mass and building time are estimated through calculation. These results establish a feasible and effective decisional method to find the most sustainable solution for the 3D printing of functional parts by comparing different sets of parameters.

In the machining process, waste treatment of waste water-soluble coolant has environmental problems. Atmospheric pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon dioxide are generated during incineration of waste water-soluble coolant. Moreover it takes large costs and time to convert the waste coolant into drainable water by chemical processing. To reduce the management cost and environmental load of water-soluble coolant, authors have been studying on a metabolic system for water-soluble coolant. More than 90% of waste water-soluble coolant is composed of water phase. If the oily additives and contaminants can be isolated from the waste coolant with low energy and material consumption, the amount of waste coolant decreases remarkably because the recycled water can be reutilized as a diluent of renewal coolant. Authors has been developed some types of water recovery methods for the metabolic system. The recovered water from waste coolant has the potential as the diluent for renewal coolant. Most of water-soluble coolants contain alkanolamines for corrosion inhibition and pH maintenance. However, alkanolamines are difficult to eliminate from water-soluble coolant in waste treatment by both of chemical and physical processes. The residual alkanolamines increase the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the waste coolants. Some amine-free water-soluble coolants have been developed and commercially available. The reduction of environmental load in waste treatment of coolant is expected by amine-free coolant. In the metabolic system, recyclability of coolants is important. In this report, we focused on multiple recycle use of amine-free water-soluble coolant. We examined recyclability, lubrication and cooling performance and ability change of recycle amine-free water-soluble coolant.

One way to improve its sustainability is via distributed recycling of plastics in homes, schools, and libraries to create feedstock filament for printing. Risks from exposures incurred during recycling and reuse of plastics has not been incorporated into life cycle assessments. This study characterized contaminant releases from virgin (unextruded) and recycled plastics from filament production through FFF 3-D printing. Waste polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastics were recycled to create filament; virgin PLA, ABS, high and low density polyethylenes, high impact polystyrene, and polypropylene pellets were also extruded into filament. The release of particles and chemicals into school classrooms was evaluated using standard industrial hygiene methodologies. All tasks released particles that contained hazardous metals (e.g., manganese) and with size capable of depositing in the gas exchange region of the lung, i.e., granulation of waste PLA and ABS (667 to 714 nm) and filament making (608 to 711 nm) and FFF 3-D printing (616 to 731 nm) with waste and virgin plastics. All tasks released vapors, including respiratory irritants and potential carcinogens (benzene and formaldehyde), mucus membrane irritants (acetone, xylenes, ethylbenzene, and methyl methacrylate), and asthmagens (styrene, multiple carbonyl compounds). These data are useful for incorporating risks of exposure to hazardous contaminants in future life cycle evaluations to demonstrate the sustainability and circular economy potential of FFF 3-D printing in distributed spaces.

Layer upon layer, the polymeric particles are selectively impregnated with two different inks and then fused and consolidated by an infrared (IR) lamp. Much faster than other AM techniques for polymers, MJF has shown exciting potentialities. However, little is known about the consolidation mechanisms acting in MJF and about the effect on the properties of the finished parts of the quality of the materials, powder and inks, and of the printing conditions. The present contribution investigates these issues. The study also compares virgin PA12 powder with pure PA12, recycled PA12 for MJF and PA12 for in selective laser sintering (SLS). The powders showed slight differences. The two inks have the same composition, except for the presence of graphitic carbon. Tensile tests showed that the printed parts are isotropic. However, the deformation at break is affected by building direction of the sample. Occasionally, poor inter-layer adhesion is observed and the tensile strength and the deformation at break collapse. Printed tensile specimens are found to be representative of the material behaviour of a printed component, apart from the deformation at break which is systematically overestimated.

J	Um, N; Park, SO; Yoon, CW; Jeon, TW				Um, Namil; Park, Seon-Oh; Yoon, Cheol-Woo; Jeon, Tae-Wan			A pretreatment method for effective utilization of copper product manufacturing waste	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Copper product manufacturing waste; Environmental assessment; Pretreatment method; Magnetic separation; Alkali leaching	ZINC-OXIDE; METALS; RECOVERY; MANAGEMENT; SULFIDE; KOREA; SLAG	In South Korea, the manufacturing system from chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) to Cu products is divided into two parts: electrolytic Cu manufacturing and Cu product manufacturing (CPM). Most of the CPM waste is deposited in landfills unlike the waste generated in electrolytic Cu manufacturing that has a good recycling ability. Therefore, in this study, a method to improve the utilization of CPM waste was proposed as a case study for South Korea. Furthermore, the CPM was investigated and classified into five types in terms of the raw materials, major products, additives, main processes, and characteristics of the CPM waste (waste type, particle size, and chemical composition). Next, the CPM waste was environmentally assessed via leaching toxicity tests using the Korean standard official method, ES 06150. In addition, the amount of specific heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Cd, As, Hg, and Cr6+) was determined to confirm the presence of substances labeled as hazardous waste. Based on these results, a pretreatment method with grinding (under 0.1 mm), screening (0.15 mm grid), magnetic separation (1.0 T), and alkali leaching (30-90 degrees C and 1-5 mol/dm(3)) was proposed. The final materials can be categorized into groups, such as fine-particle groups with high Zn and Fe contents, leachate groups with high Cu and Zn concentrations, and metal-scrap groups. Moreover, material flow analysis of all CPM waste streams in the designed pretreatment method was conducted in South Korea in 2019.

A two-step optimization methodology was adopted. First, the material composition was optimized by phase compatibilization using maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) and maleic anhydride grafted ethylene octene metallocene copolymer (EO-g-MAH) as additives. Then, the manufacturing process (extrusion followed by injection) was optimized in terms of temperature profile and screw speed for extrusion, as well as barrel temperature profile, mold temperature, injection speed, injection pressure, injection time and back pressure for injection. The results showed that, besides good fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion, the combination of both optimization paths promoted an optimum balance between components degradation and composite homogeneity (good fiber and additives dispersion in the matrix), leading to better mechanical properties. It is shown that this optimization procedure was able to improve all the mechanical properties of the composites, as well as being effective in terms of performance and costs.

A practical proposal for utilisation of water hyacinth: Recycling in fired bricks	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Water hyacinth; Fired brick; Sustainable development; Additives; Compressive strength	SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL; CLAY BRICKS; EICHHORNIA-CRASSIPES; TECHNOLOGICAL EXAMINATION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; WASTE MATERIALS; HEAVY-METALS; SOLID-WASTE; SLUDGE; RESIDUES	Strenuous efforts are being made to make the manufacturing activities sustainable. Consequently, industries are seeking ways not only to reduce energy consumption, waste accumulation and carbon footprint but also to reduce exploitation of precious natural resources. Fertile soil is one such precious resource which is being used for brick manufacturing for centuries. Brick industry needs frugal innovations to accommodate large quantities of waste and to make the production processes sustainable. Numerous studies in the past have tried to recycle waste materials by incorporating them into the brick production cycle. This experimental feasibility study is first to demonstrate the use of aquatic weed (water hyacinth) in brick manufacturing. Using chemical-mineralogical and physical-mechanical characterization, optimal mixing ratio of water hyacinth (WH) and soil was determined for achieving the desirable mechanical properties (compressive strength and water absorption) of a fired clay brick compliant with Indian and ASTM standard codes. XRD results confirmed that addition of WH does not cause compositional changes in the phase and leads merely to an increased porosity in bricks. An optimum mix of 10% WH with soil and a firing temperature of 900 degrees C were found appropriate for brick production using WH as a partial substitute to the soil. Greenhouse gas (CO2) emission during firing was ascertained and it was estimated that incorporation of 10% WH leads to 7% net saving in the consumption of external fuel required for firing the bricks.

J	Gino, G				Gino, Gianandrea			Chemical risks assessment for workers health and safety in additive manufacturing process with micrometric powder of Ti-6Al-4V alloy	METALLURGIA ITALIANA			Italian	Article						ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING; TI6AL4V; OCCUPATIONAL HYGIENE; CHEMICAL RISKS; BLANKETING		The increasing development in many productive sectors of additive manufacturing may be accompanied by an inadequate set-up in pre-existing environments. An a priori knowledge of potential problems, but also of effective solutions in place, can contribute to the minimization of occupational risks since the design stage. Being a recent technology, with a reduced amount of consolidated knowledge on the OHS aspects, is conducted a chemical risk assessment for an additive production with micrometric metal powders. To fulfill the Italian law for Workers Health and Safety, Decree no 81/2008, requirements (Figure 1), using risk assessment methodologies and occupational good practices (Table 1), the main chemical risks for safety and health and the related controls are identified. Workers' exposure during a production cycle (Figure 2) with a widespread titanium alloy Ti6Al4V (Table 2 and 3) has been investigated. The inhalation risk due to airborne particles depends on the equivalent aerodynamic diameter that affects the three respiratory tracts of the respiratory system (table 4) and the health hazards of constituent substances. The compliance with Occupational Exposure Limit Values (Table 5) was verified in accordance with the Italian Workers Health and Safety Decree Exposure monitoring, conducted according to the occupational hygiene methodology and the U NI EN 689/2019 standard. The worker exposition (table 5 & 6) was very low both for dust (Risk index between 0,08 and 0,17) and for the single components of the alloy and their sum: l = Sigma ict/VLEi = 0.019. The results are aligned with the best data from published literature [4, 5, 7, 8, 9]. The dedicated HVAC system, with top-down air distribution, equipped with a HEPA13 filter inserted in the air recycling system, allows minimizing both the risk of exposure inside the dedicated working environment and contamination towards the outside. Due to blanketing requirements, a worst-case analysis has been developed for the Argon distribution, stressing a danger of hypo-oxygenated atmosphere and the need for an oxygen detection system. Fire and explosion due to metal powders prevention require the AtEx zones classification and consequent actions to reduce the risk of ignition by electrostatic charges, exothermic oxidation, and the development of hydrogen detection system and fire alarm. In the aim of risk evaluation in Additive Manufacturing with Titanium alloy metal powder, classified non-cancerogenic, this study has verified the full compliance of the adopted measures and allowed to implement further ones. Although highlighting the need for further checks and investigations, has been identified a prevalence of chemical safety risks compared to workers' health risk.

This conveying system is modeled as a conveying pipeline in an additive-manufacturing (AM)-recycling system. The gas phase is set to nitrogen, and the solid-particle phase is set to be a nickel-superalloy material used in AM. The two-phase-flow dynamics of the transport of metal powders by the pneumatic-conveying process are investigated by the CFD-DEM simulation method. In particular, we focus on the flow characteristics of the gas and solid-particle phases in the region of the conveying-pipe bend. The dynamics of the gas phase are evaluated via the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The metal powders are treated as a discrete phase and modeled via the Lagrangian-tracking approach and solved using Newton's second law. The secondary-flow pattern and rotating Dean vortices of the gas flow are discussed in terms of the conveying-pipe-bend-curvature effect. The rope-formation/dispersion behaviors of the solid-particle phase in the bends of different curvatures are also examined based on particle-gas-interaction forces. Experimental validation is conducted to verify the simulation results of the powder flow. The trajectories and velocity fields of the metal powders in the bends with different curvatures are measured in the experiments. The rope-formation/dispersion behaviors can also be found in the experiments. It is demonstrated that the numerical simulations and experimental observations are generally in good agreement. This framework will potentially aid in investigating recycling processes for AM applications under large metal-powder loadings.

J	Sengoz, B; Topal, A				Sengoz, B; Topal, A			Use of asphalt roofing shingle waste in HMA	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						roofing shingle waste; recycling; hot-mix asphalt; rutting resistance		Like other construction materials, shingles have their own service life based on raw materials, production method and environmental and climatic conditions. At the end of their service life, shingles need to be replaced. However, these old shingles together with manufacturing scrap and handling waste require large storage areas and pollute the environment in time. Hence, additional usage of shingle waste is desirable. In this study, shingle waste in amounts of 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% and 5% by weight was added as an additive to asphalt concrete mixes prepared with the optimum binder content which yielded the best stability value was 5%. After determination of the optimum percentage of shingle to be added, rutting tests were performed on the specimens. Taking into account, the binder content existing in the shingle, mixtures were prepared with the reduced binder content by 0.5% and 1.0%. Test results show that waste shingles can be used in HMA as an additive to improve the Marshall stability and rutting resistance of the mixtures. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Understanding the Effect of Machine Technology and Cellulosic Fibers on Tissue Properties - A Review	BIORESOURCES			English	Review						Tissue paper properties; Softness; Water absorbency; Wet strength; Dry strength; Tissue machine technology; Cellulosic fibers; Mechanical refining	PAPER; PULP; STRENGTH; PRODUCTS; SOFTNESS; BAGASSE; TOWEL	Hygiene tissue paper properties are a function of fiber type, chemical additives, and machine technology. This review presents a comprehensive and systematic discussion about the effects of the type of fiber and machine technology on tissue properties. Advanced technologies, such as through-air drying, produce tissue with high bulk, softness, and absorbency. Conventional technologies, where wet pressing is used to partially dewater the paper web, produces tissue with higher density, lower absorbency, and softness. Different fiber types coming from various pulping and recycling processes are used for tissue manufacturing. Softwoods are mainly used as a source of reinforcement, while hardwoods provide softness and a velvet type surface feel. Non-wood biomass may have properties similar to hardwoods and/or softwoods, depending on the species. Mechanical pulps having stiffer fibers result in bulkier papers. Chemical pulps have flexible fibers resulting in better bonding ability and softness. Virgin fibers are more flexible and produce stronger and softer tissue. Recycled fibers are stiffer with lower bonding ability, yielding products that are weaker and less soft. Mild mechanical refining is used to improve limitations found in recycled fibers and to develop properties in virgin fibers. At the same time that refining increases strength, it also decreases bulk and water absorbency.

J	Liu, PY; Farzana, R; Rajarao, R; Sahajwalla, V				Liu, Peiyao; Farzana, Rifat; Rajarao, Ravindra; Sahajwalla, Veena			Lightweight expanded aggregates from the mixture of waste automotive if plastics and clay	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						ASR plastics; Lightweight aggregate; Sustainability; Porous clay; Waste	SEWAGE-SLUDGE; FLY-ASH; PERFORMANCE; CHALLENGES; GLASS	Significant amount of waste associated with end of life vehicles enter waste stream each year and are usually disposed of in landfill, creating an environmental burden. Recycling automotive waste is very tedious and difficult due to its heterogeneous composition and nature. It is critically required to develop a solution to recycle and reuse these potential resources. In this paper, a novel recycling approach is established to produce lightweight aggregate by incorporating automotive shredded residual (ASR) plastics into clay at 1200 degrees C. The physical properties of lightweight aggregate such as bulk density, porosity and water absorption have been investigated. ASR plastics as pore-forming or gas releasing agent increased the porosity of the clay mixture. Incorporation of 2 wt% of ASR plastics into clay composite lead to a benefit of approximately 30% bulk density decrease and 40% porosity increase compared to the reference clay material used in this study. The obtained superior lightweight and porous aggregate products by using ASR plastics can be used in thermal insulation materials and also as substrates in soilless cultivation. This innovative approach could also help reduce the volume of autoplastics in landfills and could be a potential replacement of conventional additives in manufacturing composite materials for building applications.

Additives were used to produce warm bituminous mixtures. Fatigue behaviour and thermomechanical behaviour at low temperature were investigated. Fatigue was studied by analysing the tension/compression fatigue test results. Four different failure criteria were used in order to evaluate fatigue life. The low temperature behaviour of the materials was characterized using the Thermal Stress Restrained Specimen Test (TSRST). For each material, three replicates were performed. The experimental device was improved so that radial strains in two directions could be measured during the tests. Tri-dimensional behaviour could thus be investigated. The results of both tests were analysed and the influence of the void content, RAP content, type of additives and manufacturing process was evaluated.

The assumptions of the behaviour of individual components and subsystems of the design result from an extensive application of the finite element method and motion analysis of subsystems and various parts of the structure. The use of this method to such an extent accelerated the design process and its implementation. The proposal itself reflects the current state of this technology and its focus is on improving sustainable development. As is generally known, great efforts are currently being made to reduce plastic waste volume and its environmental burden. The proposed concept is modified to replace the final treatment of the top layers of the models, called "ironing" by non-planar layering of material. At the same time, it points out the advantages of this method in reducing energy requirements and the time required to produce models. The conclusion is a conceptual design of a printhead for a proposed prototype, designed to use recycled FDM, intending to streamline the possibility of recycling with little serial and piece production. This process thus closes the circle of opportunities published by us, which in the future can contribute to the optimisation of this technology towards increasing the efficiency of resource use, reduction of energy demands and environmental burden.

Unfortunately, most post-consumer rubber-derived products are still discarded as waste, buried in landfills or incinerated. Such materials require many years to degrade naturally due to i) their complex cross-linked composition, and ii) the additives used during manufacturing to extend the lifespan of rubber. Extensive research has investigated the use of end-of-life rubber as binder (e.g. elastomers, bitumen), or as conglomerates (cement, gypsums) to produce innovative composites in construction. To improve the properties of composites made with recycled rubber, the surface of rubber has been treated with different costly processes to improve the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ). However, the results available in the literature are inconsistent and many technical and practical aspects remain unsolved, thus preventing the cost-effective use of rubber in the construction industry. This study provides a comprehensive review on rubber properties and surface treatments of rubber recycled from post-consumer components so as to identify potential applications in composites for construction. It is concluded that an understanding of the chemical, physical and mechanical properties of rubber, as well as a proper characterisation, are necessary to take full advantage of this high quality material. Future research needs in the field are also suggested. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Currently, the distillation remnants of Kuma Shochu are concentrated and recycled as fertilizer and animal feeds, which are relatively low-value materials (about $50 per ton). The distilleries' cost for recycling is more than $100 per ton of the distillation remnants, and this cost is a financial burden for the distilleries. For more value-added use of the distillation remnants, we proposed that the distillation remnants be used to provide culture nutrients for photosynthetic bacteria (PSB), which has ability to promote the growth of plants and can be applied to various agricultural practices. We screened 22 PSB strains for growth in the diluted distillation remnants of Kuma Shochu and successfully isolated 4 PSB strains that grew well without any additives. The effectiveness of the PSB cultured in the distillation remnants (Kuma PSB) was examined with field experiments by the agricultural high school students in the region, and their results indicated that the fresh weights of cabbage, Chinese cabbage, broccoli, and Japanese radish were significantly increased by the PSB treatment. We used these PSB strains to start a university-student-run business venture for manufacturing and distributing the Kuma PSB to local farmers. The present study is the first example of the use of PSB for the recycling of distillation remnants of spirits, and can widely be applied to various spirit industries in the world. [GRAPHICS] .

DMLS technology uses a high intensity laser to build components layer by layer, directly from metal powder. CAD data is directly converted to part without the need for tooling. It is possible to build internal features and passages that are not possible in conventional manufacturing routes. The process generates significant amount of condensate due to vaporization and suction applied to build chamber. Typically as much as 30% of the weight of powder ends up as condensate. The condensate so generated cannot be directly recycled. This results in significant reduction in profitability and process efficiency. This study pertains to 18% Ni Maraging Steel grade C300, which commonly used in DMLS process. Maraging Steel is used extensively to build functional parts by DMLS process especially for Tool and Die applications. In the present study chemistry, particle size distribution & morphology of the condensate was studied & compared with the powder. Parts were built using condensate and chemical, physical, mechanical, microstructure and XRD studies were done. These properties were compared with properties of parts built using fresh powder. No difficulty was encountered in building parts using condensate. However, hardness and tensile properties were found to be inferior, thus it is not possible to recycle the condensate directly. Present research investigates the cause of difference in these properties.

J	Yan, SQ; Sagoe-Crentsil, K				Yan, Shiqin; Sagoe-Crentsil, Kwesi			Properties of wastepaper sludge in geopolymer mortars for masonry applications	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Wastepaper sludge; Geopolymer; Mortar; Compressive strength; Drying shrinkage; Water absorption; Recycling	CEMENT; IMMOBILIZATION; ASHES; REUSE	This paper presents the results of an investigation into the use of wastepaper sludge in geopolymer mortar systems for manufacturing construction products. The investigation was driven by the increasing demand for reuse options in paper-recycling industry. Both fresh and hardened geopolymer mortar properties are evaluated for samples incorporating dry wastepaper sludge, and the results indicate potential end-use benefits in building product manufacture. Addition of wastepaper sludge to geopolymer mortar reduces flow properties, primarily due to dry sludge absorbing water from the binder mix. The average 91-day compressive strength of mortar samples incorporating 2.5 wt% and 10 wt% wastepaper sludge respectively retained 92% and 52% of the reference mortar strength. However, contrary to the normal trend of increasing drying shrinkage with increasing paper sludge addition to Portland cement matrices, the corresponding geopolymer drying shrinkage decreased by 34% and 64%. Equally important, the water absorption of hardened geopolymer mortar decreased with increasing paper sludge content at ambient temperatures, providing good prospects of overall potential for wastepaper sludge incorporation in the production of building and masonry elements. The results indicate that, despite its high moisture absorbance due to the organic matter and residual cellulose fibre content, wastepaper sludge appears compatible with geopolymer chemistry, and hence serves as a potential supplementary additive to geopolymer cementitious masonry products.

Evolution of 316L stainless steel feedstock due to laser powder bed fusion process	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Stainless steel; Selective laser melting; Powder reuse; Mechanical properties; Microstructure; Powder bed fusion; Powder recycling; Materials characterization; Scanning electron microscopy; Spatter; Powder metallurgy; Rapid manufacturing; Powder feedstock; Rapid solidification; Metal powder; X-ray computed tomography; Electron backscatter diffraction; Melt pool	PARTICLE PROPERTIES; METAL POWDERS; BEHAVIOR; SPATTER; MICROSTRUCTURE; FLOWABILITY; DENUDATION; MECHANISMS; DEPOSITION; POROSITY	Some of the primary barriers to widespread adoption of metal additive manufacturing (AM) are persistent defect formation in built components, high material costs, and lack of consistency in powder feedstock. To generate more reliable, complex-shaped metal parts, it is crucial to understand how feedstock properties change with reuse and how that affects build mechanical performance. Powder particles interacting with the energy source, yet not consolidated into an AM part can undergo a range of dynamic thermal interactions, resulting in variable particle behavior if reused. In this work, we present a systematic study of 316L powder properties from the virgin state through thirty powder reuses in the laser powder bed fusion process. Thirteen powder characteristics and the resulting AM build mechanical properties were investigated for both powder states. Results show greater variability in part ductility for the virgin state. The feedstock exhibited minor changes to size distribution, bulk composition, and hardness with reuse, but significant changes to particle morphology, microstructure, magnetic properties, surface composition, and oxide thickness. Additionally, sieved powder, along with resulting fume/ condensate and recoil ejecta (spatter) properties were characterized. Formation mechanisms are proposed. It was discovered that spatter leads to formation of single crystal ferrite through large degrees of supercooling and massive solidification. Ferrite content and consequently magnetic susceptibility of the powder also increases with reuse, suggesting potential for magnetic separation as a refining technique for altered feedstock.

Oxide and spatter powder formation during laser powder bed fusion of Hastelloy X	POWDER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Laser powder bed fusion; Spatter; Hastelloy X; Oxides; Recyclability; Additive manufacturing	METAL POWDERS	Improvement to the integrity of laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) processed Nickel-base superalloys is crucial for their wider adoption in industrial aerospace applications. The nature of PBF-LB, essentially an extended powder micro-welding process, allows opportunity for material contamination and oxidisation. This study reports how oxide formation occurs in Hastelloy X corresponding to ASTM composition, and in particular, in the material ejected from the process zone during fabrication (spatter). It is shown that oxidation occurs despite processing in an Ar atmosphere with <0.2% O-2, and moreover, this can result in oxide inclusions in built parts. The spatter particles are also associated with part defects. Depending on the sieve size used, 30-60% of oxidised spatter particles are within the size range to be recycled and reprocessed in subsequent uses. This impacts the processing of powder in PBF-LB, powder quality in use in the technology, and powder manufacture in the industry. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Gasper, A. N.

A circular economy (CE) constitutes a regenerative systemic approach to economic development which views waste as a valuable resource to be reprocessed back into the economy. In order to understand the circular strategy for a systemic change from an LE to a CE as a means of resolving the issue of plastic waste, this research aims to map current circular strategy trends across the system perspective contained in the literature relating to plastic CE literature. The novelty of the research lies in the mapping and review of the distribution of comprehensive circular strategies within the 9R framework across the entire system perspective (e.g. micro-meso-macro) down to its sub-levels in the literature on a plastic CE. The bibliographic mapping and systematic literature review iindicateed that the majority of the research focused on recycle (R8), followed by refuse (R0), reuse (R3), and reduce (R2). Certain circular strategies are more appropriate to handling certain plastic materials, despite CE's favoring of prevention and recycling over incineration. Recover (R9) is often used to process mixed and contaminated plastic. Recycling (R8) is the most popular circular strategy and the most applicable to plastic material with three recycle trends, namely; mechanical recycling, chemical recycling and DRAM (Distributed-Recycling-and-Additive-Manufacturing). Prolonging the product life through refurbishing (R5) is not applicable to plastic due to its material limitations. Reduce (R2) popularity as circular strategy reflects the preference to reduce consumption, either by launching campaigns to prevent waste or increasing production efficiency. Research on Rethink (R1) has largely focused on rethinking product design, consumer and organization behavior and perceptions of CE. Refuse (R0) strategy is an adoption of bio-based plastics which have a similar function to fossil-based plastics.

Built parts are embedded in residual unmolten powder, the so-called part cake, which undergoes thermal ageing effects due to the exposure to high temperatures for long times during the manufacturing process. Hence, the recyclability of the unmolten powder is limited. This article focuses on a fundamental analysis of the ageing kinetics dependent on time, temperature, and oxygen content in the gas atmosphere. A model is developed and applied to measured, position-dependent process temperature histories to successfully predict the ageing distribution within a part cake. The results can be used to optimize the thermal process management in LS and to develop new efficient powder recycling methods. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2017, 134, 45435.

A Review on Materials and Technologies for Organic Large-Area Electronics	ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES			English	Review						additive manufacturing technologies; organic large&#8208; area electronics; organic materials; printed electronics; sustainable development	SENSORS	New and innovative applications in the field of electronics are rapidly emerging. Such applications often require flexible or stretchable substrates, lightweight and transparent materials, and design freedom. This paper offers a complete overview concerning flexible electronics manufacturing, focusing on the materials and technologies that have been recently developed. This combination of materials and technologies aims to fuel a fast, economical, and environmentally sustainable transition from the conventional to the novel and highly customizable electronics. Organic conductors, semiconductors, and dielectrics have recently gathered lots of attention since they are compatible with printing technologies, and can be easily spread over large and flexible substrates. These printing technologies are usually simple and fast procedures, which rely on low-cost and recycle-friendly materials, intended for large-scale fabrication. Overall, even though organic large-area electronics manufacturing is still in its early stages of development, it is a field with tremendous potential that holds promise to revolutionize the way products are designed, developed, and processed from the factory premises to the consumers' hands. Besides, this technology is highly versatile and can be applied to a large array of sectors such as automotive, medical, home design, industrial, agricultural, among others.

The first step in such manufacturing process is the Sulfur modification using polymeric additives to control sulfur crystallization and to prevent macro-crystals growth. In a controlled temperature surroundings, modified Sulfur was mixed with elemental sulfur, fly ash and desert sand to form the newly SPC. The durability of the SPC was evaluated in: de-ionized water, acidic Solutions of 20, 40, 70, and 98 wt% H(2)SO(4) solutions, and saline Solutions of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wt% NaCl, at different temperatures for different periods of time. To compare the SPC results with known material, normal Portland cement concrete (PCC) mortars were also studied. The results indicated that the manufactured SPC material has high compressive strength, low hydraulic conductivity, and high resistance to permeation of water, and particularly resistant to corrosion in acid and salt environments.

Assembled, Modular Hardware Architectures - What Price Reconfigurability?	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			SPACE; SYSTEMS; TECHNOLOGY	Recent robotic technology advances have motivated increased interest in the potential of on-orbit assembly to significantly enhance mission capability and scope. Re-usability of space exploration hardware in general is often discussed for its potential to vastly reduce the cost of space operations, and is cited as a potential benefit of on-orbit robotics. But does reconfigurability come at the cost of assembly or performance efficiency? This article specifically evaluates the potential use of highly modular material systems - such as reversibly assembled cellular composite materials - as the basis for re-configurable exploration hardware. First, a dimensional scaling argument is presented to suggest that systems of all sizes can benefit from mass savings associated on-orbit assembly. Next, we examine the relative energetic cost of various strategies for on-orbit manufacturing ( reconfiguration, reuse/recycling, deposition based additive manufacturing, or conventional forming processes) and conclude that investment in mechanically assembled reconfigurable material systems holds the potential for orders of magnitude reduction of energy required for long-term on-orbit manufacturing activities. We propose that discretely assembled cellular materials are strong candidate systems, and show that the parasitic mass penalty associated with reversible mechanical connection hardware can be characterized and is well-bounded. Finally, we discuss notional missions at a high level to motivate future detailed analysis and evaluation of various mission architectures.

Thermal conductivity enhancement of recycled high density polyethylene as a storage media for latent heat thermal energy storage	SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS			English	Article						Thermal energy storage; Phase change material; Thermal conductivity; Recycled composite	PHASE-CHANGE MATERIAL; CHANGE MATERIAL PCM; COMPOSITE; SOLIDIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; BUILDINGS; ADDITIVES; SYSTEM; TUBE; FINS	In the context of reducing CO2 emissions and balancing energy supply and demand across the electricity grid, energy storage has become an important topic. Therefore, new energy policies are looking for more efficient and environmental friendly technologies. The aim of this research is to assist in the implementation of the renewable energies technologies and to improve the energy efficiency in well-known and established processes by recovering and storing heat. Moreover, the use of a recycled material as a storage media for thermal energy storage applications shows a more sustainable use of resources reducing at the same time the overall cost. In this research a novel composite, a recycled high density polyethylene (HDPE)/graphite(Cg) mixture, for medium temperature thermal energy storage application has been formulated and characterized. One common characteristic of polymers is their low thermal conductivities. This causes a slow thermal response when the PCM is used in high power applications. In this study the thermal conductivity properties of the HDPE/Cg were enhanced by the optimization of its manufacturing process and composition. Graphite content was added in different mass fractions into the PCM, and thermal properties were measured by means of Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Laser Flash Analysis (LFA). The experimental results showed that the thermal conductivities are improved by the higher mass fraction of graphite. When the graphite content was in the ratio of 20 wt%, the thermal conductivity of the PCM increased from 0.51 W m(-1) K-1 up to 1.31 W m(-1) K-1. The secondary electron microscopy confirms a good homogeneity of the manufacturing process. Further chemical stability analysis was performed by means of charging and discharging processes. The cycled samples present good thermal property reliability at temperatures up to 250 degrees C. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Wu, HS				Wu, Haishang			Business model and methods of evaluation in sustainable manufacturing	MANUFACTURING REVIEW			English	Article						sustainability; material recycling; collaboration; localization; standard; AM; CM; SME	ADVANTAGES	Additive manufacturing (AM) enables cost-effective and efficient production toward sustainability. However, a rigorous evaluation method is required to further investigate the measurement method and efficiency before AM can be well-positioned in sustainable manufacturing and become the industry mainstream. Cost savings play a key role in the manufacturing industry. Compared to conventional manufacturing (CM), the cost of AM is volume-independent. In contrast, CM production requires a certain volume to share the initial tooling costs to achieve cost reduction. This constraint limits CM from service on demand and leaves ambiguity in the threshold setting of that critical batch volume. In addition, the invisibility of AM advantages in cost factors blocks AM technologies from appropriate processes and affects its applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a business model. The major issues encountered by AM are the scaling, speed, and size of products. The enhancement of cost modeling and addressing speed, scale, and size issues are the novelties of this study and provide a breakthrough in AM issues. Generic equations are derived using the convergence effect and cost-volume intersection calculation between AM and CM. Furthermore, the divide-and-conquer approach is proposed to support scaling factors and dependencies for both AM and CM. Consequently, appropriate AM technologies can be compared with the CM convergence threshold to contribute to decision-making. Next, the advantages and weaknesses of AM are identified, and a collaboration pattern is proposed to connect large enterprises, small-and medium-sized enterprises, and home-based manufacturers into an AM society. Through this society, the advantages of AM can be fully exploited, scaling and speed issues can be addressed, and AM's dominant role in sustainable manufacturing can be made feasible.

Establishing a new "zero waste" impact scheme, in order to recover by-products from the production process, thus leading to an increased market price in comparison to their economic value, and by doing so with full respect of the blue and circular economy standards applied to the product. The main objective of the PVC upcycling project is to facilitate the transition of R.ED.EL.'s current production chain, from an economically linear model to a circular type. This is achieved through actions that aim to recycle PVC (polyvinyl chloride materials) from electrical cables ("de-manufacturing") to upcycling the same PVC into new products with a low environmental impact ("remanufacturing"). While working from the de-manufacturing phase to the re-manufacturing phase, activating circular models with new PVC-MPS supply chains, and implementing experiments in specifically illustrated scenarios, it has also been possible to build a collaborative platform to exchange information. This process intercepts the eco-design phase thus realizing the possibility of intervention in the production of PVCupcycling prototypes. The project won the regional competition of Calabria (EU funds-POR Calabria 14-20 axis I-action 1.2.2) and has received European funding for the "Promotion of Research and Innovation" thanks to the proposal of the following team: R.ED.EL., a media manufacturing company, in collaboration with ENEA, an Italian energy specialist research organization, UNICAL, a chemistry specialist organ-isation based at the University of Calabria, PMopenlab, an innovative eco-design and additive manufacturing start-up.

These additive manufacturing technologies show competitive advantages over conventional processes, however only a few studies have assessed their environmental implications. In this work, the environmental performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack produced using a novel 3D printing approach is conducted for the first time using Life Cycle Assessment. In addition, a comparative study with conventional manufacturing methods is carried out. The results reveal that the production of the 3D printing materials has the highest environmental impact (between 50% and 98%) in half of the categories studied. In contrast, the end-of-life stage represents less than 1% of the total impact. End-of-life scenarios are also presented and discussed, indicating that a recycling rate of 70% for Nickel and YSZ materials performs better than the defined landfill and incineration disposal scenarios. Furthermore, 3D printing shows the best overall environmental performance compared to other conventional methods. The main improvement is seen in the material production stage, where a savings ranging from 37% to 97% (depending on the category analysed) is observed. This is mainly due to the use of a ceramic material for the interconnects instead of Chromium-based alloys used in a more conventional approach. Finally, it was observed that the energy required for 3D printing in the manufacturing stage is a sensible parameter to the environmental performance of the SOFC 3D printing technology.

Moreover, ceramized products may represent an important secondary source to replace clay materials and cut down manufacturing costs. After characterization, in order to prepare specimens by uniaxial die pressing, mud was incorporated into a clay matrix at rates between 1 and 5 wt %. Compression strength, linear contraction, suction capacity and water absorption of the moulded materials were evaluated. Finally, metal leakage was characterized through chemical analysis of lixiviates. The results showed an improvement in mechanical properties following the incorporation of mud into the ceramic materials. The resulting materials meet health and safety regulations regarding dangerous waste recycling.	[Corpas Iglesias, F.

The present results help to confirm a hypothesis that observed strength gains, in cases where the amount of the first additive exceeded the adsorption capacity of the fibers, were due to the formation of polyclectrolyte complexes in the solution phase, followed by their deposition onto fiber surfaces.

Dynamic Semicrystalline Networks of Polypropylene with Thiol-Anhydride Exchangeable Crosslinks	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						thermoplastic; polypropylene; vitrimer; thiol-anhydrate; thiol-thioester; plastic recycling; 3D printing	MALEIC-ANHYDRIDE; POLYETHYLENE; VITRIMERS; COPOLYMERS; OSTEOLYSIS; MORPHOLOGY; MOLTEN; WEAR	Thermoplastic polyolefins (TPOs) crosslinked by dynamic covalent bonds (xTPOs) have the potential to be the most utilized class of polymer in the world, with applications ranging from household and automotive to biomedical devices and additive manufacturing. xTPO combines the benefits of thermoplastics and thermosets in a "single material" and potentially avoids their shortcomings. Here, we describe a new two-stage reaction extrusion strategy of TPOs with a backbone consisting of inert C-C bonds (polypropylene, PP), and thiol-anhydride, to dynamically crosslink PP through thiol-thioester bond exchange. The degree of PP crosslinking determines the rubber plateau modulus above the melting point of the plastic: the modulus at 200 degrees C increases from zero in the melt to 23 kPa at 6% crosslinking, to 60 kPa at 20%, to 105 kPa at 40%. The overall mechanical strength of the solid xTPO plastic is 25% higher compared to the original PP, and the gel fraction of xTPO reaches 55%. Finally, we demonstrate that the crosslinked xTPO material is readily reprocessable (recycled, remolded, rewelded, and 3D printed).

Production of monolithic, load-bearing, heat-insulating wall structures by additive manufacturing with foam concrete	BAUINGENIEUR			German	Article							STRENGTH; MODEL	Concrete 3D printing using the CONPrint3D process is a continuous, formwork-free construction technology that enables the economic erection of concrete components and building structures under construction site conditions. In the present article, an extension of this method to foam concrete is presented. Foam concrete is characterized by a low density and high thermal insulation capacity, while it exhibits sufficient compressive strength for the load-bearing function. Given an adequate monolithic wall thickness of foam concrete, additional thermal insulation in structural engineering may be dispensed with. This not only speeds up the complete production of walls, but also simplifies the recycling after the end of the buildings' service life. The article examines the production process, material design and material testing as well as construction management aspects of the new technology.

Processed construction and demolition waste materials mixed with plastics and additives were extruded into hollow test bars using a conical rotary extruder. Test specimens needed for measurements were cut from test bars. The results showed that the mechanical performance of wood-plastic composites based on construction and demolition waste wood, and mineral wool was at a good level and comparable to commonly used wood-plastic composites in decking applications. The highest strength properties of wood-plastic composites were achieved with a plywood fraction and the lowest with materials containing a particle/fibre board fraction. The mechanical performance can be improved by utilizing mineral wool in the formulation of wood-plastic composites. A material mixture containing several wood fractions as well as mineral wool also gave good strength properties. Only a minor reduction in strength properties was measured when recycled plastic was utilized meaning that wood-plastic composites suitable for many types of applications can be produced entirely from recycled materials.

In order to reduce greenhouse (GHG) emissions from the aluminum industry and to add a value to the residue of wood industry, a small part of the calcined petroleum coke, used for the production of carbon anodes, was replaced with biocoke produced from wood by-products. Since the addition of biocoke deteriorates the properties of carbon anodes, it was modified using an additive in order to assess if the modification can render biocoke more suitable for carbon anode production by modifying the surface chemistry of the biocoke. Three samples of biocoke, unmodified, modified using 3% additive and modified using 4% additive, were produced and studied before and after modification to identify its effect on biocoke properties. First, the chemical characterization was carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) to verify whether the functional groups were added to the biocoke surface during the modification. To study the influence of the biocoke modification on the biocoke/pitch interactions, the wettability of the unmodified and modified biocokes by the coal tar pitch, which is used as a binder in anodes, were measured using sessile-drop test. After, the laboratory scale anodes were produced and their green and baked densities, electrical resistivity, air and CO2 reactivities, and bending strength were measured. The results showed that the biocoke modification was effective. A number of new surface chemical groups were added to the biocoke coke surface. This improved the biocoke/pitch wettability, consequently affected the anode properties.

Metal Foam Production From AlMg4.5Mn Recycling Machining Chips by Means of Thixocasting and the Effects of Different Additives for Stabilization	POROUS METALS AND METALLIC FOAMS: METFOAM 2007			English	Proceedings Paper	5th Biennial International Conference on Porous Metals and Metallic Foams (MetFoam 2007)	SEP 05-07, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Natl Res Council Canada, Quebec Mat Network, NW Univ, Hahn Meitner Inst, McGill Univ, Inco, Quebec Met Powders, CQRDA, Fraunhofer IFAM, MetSoc, Adv Engn Mat Journal, US Natl Sci Fdn				The use of recycled machining chips instead of aluminium powder to produce foamable precursor material leads to a significant decrease of the material and manufacturing costs. For the processing of aluminium cutting chips the thixocasting technique is appropriate because this technique offers the possibility to directly use chip-slugs briquetted analogueously to the normal procedure for chip recycling. The strong shearing of chip-material and the high temperatures during the thixocasting process lead to precursor components with a homogenous structure. For the present investigation the alloy AlMg4.5Mn0.7 was selected because large quantities of chips from this alloy are available resulting from e.g. sawing processes. The challenge was to improve the known unfavourable foaming characteristics of this alloy by the addition of small quantities of stabilizing particles, elements and their combinations. For the investigations the following additives were used: CaO, TiB2, Si3N4, Al2O3, Sn, Sb, as well as the combinations of CaO with Al2O3 and CaO with Sn. The foaming agent quantity was 1w1.% TiH2 for all variants. The briquettes were heated in a conventional air-circulation furnace into the semi-solid state. After heating the slugs were transferred to the thixocasting machine and pressed into a plate cavity. For the qualitative evaluation of the foaming behaviour and the pore structure specimens of each mixture were foamed without and also within a foaming mould. The quantitative expansion and collapse behaviour of the samples were characterized with a mechanical expandometer. The different test methods showed the best foam stabilization characteristics for CaO, Si3N4 and Al2O3. Furthermore, it is interesting that the individual addition of CaO or Sri showed positive effects on the expansion, foam structure and the drainage. However, the combined addition of CaO and Sn led to good foam stabilization but also to some coarsening of the foam structure.

Green fab lab applications of large-area waste polymer-based additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Polymers; Recycling; Waste plastic; Upcycle; Circular economy	CIRCULAR ECONOMY; 3D; DESIGN; VIRGIN	Fab labs, which offer small-scale distributed digital fabrication, are forming a Green Fab Lab Network, which embraces concepts of an open source symbiotic economy and circular economy patterns. With the use of industrial 3D printers capable of fused particle fabrication/fused granular fabrication (FPF/FGF) printing directly from waste plastic streams, green fab labs could act as defacto recycling centers for converting waste plastics into valuable products for their communities. Clear financial drivers for this process have not been studied in the past. Thus, in this study the Gigabot X, an open source industrial 3D printer, which has been shown to be amenable to a wide array of recyclables for FPF/FGF 3D printing, is used to evaluate this economic potential. An economic life cycle analysis of the technology is completed comprised of three cases studies using FPF for large sporting equipment products. Sensitivities are run on the electricity costs for operation, materials costs from various feed stocks and the capacity factors of the 3D printers. The results showed that FPF/FGF 3D printing is capable of energy efficient production of a wide range of large high-value sporting goods products. In all cases, a substantial economic savings was observed when comparing the materials and energy related costs to commercial goods (even for customized goods). Using locally-sourced shredded plastic represented not only the best environmental option, but also the most economic. For the case study products analyzed even the lowest capacity factor (starting only one print per week) represented a profit when comparing to high-end value products. For some products the profit potential and return on investment was substantial (e.g. over 1000%) for high capacity use of a Gigabot X. The results clearly show that open source industrial FPF/FGF 3D printers have significant economic potential when used as a distributed recycling/manufacturing system using recyclable feed stocks in the green fab lab context.

In particular, it is essential to reveal the phenomena of recoating and melting-solidification processes in laser powder bed fusion using a real-time monitoring system because they influence strongly the occurrence of defects. This study was conducted to elucidate the correlation among the powder characteristics, recoating conditions, and surface morphology of a powder bed in the recoating process to determine the relationship between the surface morphology of the powder bed and the final product quality. To this end, a surface morphology measurement system composed of a powder recoating test bench and a layer surface morphology measurement apparatus was first designed and fabricated. Then, it was used to quantify the surface morphology of the powder bed. Specifically, the influences of the different powder characteristics and the recoating parameters of the powder supply ratio and recoating speed on the surface morphology of the powder bed were investigated using various powders of Al-10Si-0.4Mg (AlSi10Mg) alloy and Inconel 718 (IN718) alloy. The surface morphology of the powder bed was measured as the value of 2 sigma at a resolution of 30 mu m in height. It was found that the angle of repose and the basic flow energy of the bulk powder are promising parameters for evaluating the surface morphology. The surface morphology was significantly affected by the powder characteristics and recoating speed. The value of 2 sigma for the AlSi10Mg powder increased rapidly over a recoating speed of 50 mm/s for all powders. The value of 2 sigma for the irregularly shaped AlSi10Mg powder was approximately 19 mu m, and the 2 sigma values for the other powders were approximately 17 mu m at a recoating speed of 15 mm/s. However, at a recoating speed greater than 300 mm/s, the irregularly shaped powder exhibited better surface morphology than did the spherical powder. The recycling process deteriorated the flowability of the new powder. However, the surface morphology of the spherical recycled powder was similar to that of the spherical powder. Consequently, the correlation among the powder characteristics, recoating conditions, and surface morphology of the powder bed was revealed by employing the surface morphology measurement system. Quantification of the surface morphology of the powder bed using the monitoring system facilitates control of the recoating process to prevent the occurrence of defects.

This paper focuses on recycling and optimized sourcing in the paper industry as a case company. The main objective is to engage the case company with their supplier networks to diminish the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and cost in their production process. It proposes a model to support the selection of the best green supplier and an allocation of order among the potential suppliers. The proposed model contains a two-phase hybrid approach. The first phase presents the rating and selection of potential suppliers by considering economics (cost), operational factors (quality and delivery), and environmental criteria (recycle capability and GHG emission control) using Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) methodology. The second phase presents the order allocation process using multi-objective linear programming in order to minimize cost, material rejection, late delivery, recycle waste and CO2 emissions in the production process. A case study from a paper manufacturing industry is presented to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results demonstrate a 26.2% reduction of carbon emission by using recycle products in the production process. The firm benefits by forming a systematic methodology for green supplier evaluation and order allocation. Finally, a conclusion and a suggested direction of future research are introduced.

In order to recycle phosphogypsum to manufacture lightweight building materials, cementitious additives including fly ash, ground granulate blast-furnace slag and Portland cement were added to improve strength and water-resistance and different volume of foam was added to reduce the bulk density. The results show that hydrated lime can improve mechanical strength and water resistance of PG paste and the optimal dosage of hydrated lime is 6 %. Higher addition of fly ash or ground granulated blast-furnace slag improves the fluidity and delays the setting time of PG paste. The addition of 10 similar to 20 % fly ash results in a little reducing influence and 10 % ground granulated blast-furnace slag leads to an increase of 20.7 % for 28 days compressive strength of hardened PG specimen. The higher addition of Portland cement results in the better mechanical strength and water resistance of PG specimens. The 28day compressive and flexural strength reaches 25.9 MPa and 8.9 MPa respectively for the 25 % Portland cement mixture. PG based lightweight building materials can prepared by the addition of 60 % volume of air foam, with compressive strength of 1.7 MPa, bulk density of 521.7 kg/m(3) and thermal conductivity of 0.0724 W/(m.K).

J	Rahimi, M; Esfahanian, M; Moradi, M				Rahimi, Mohammad; Esfahanian, Mohsen; Moradi, Mehran			Effect of reprocessing on shrinkage and mechanical properties of ABS and investigating the proper blend of virgin and recycled ABS in injection molding	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Injection molding; ABS; Recycling; Shrinkage; Mechanical properties; Blend	ACRYLONITRILE-BUTADIENE-STYRENE	In this research, the effect of reprocessing of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) on the mechanical properties of the polymer was studied through a five-stage reprocessing. To this end, the injection mold of the standard samples was manufactured. Then, using an injection molding machine, all of the virgin material was processed. After sampling, the rest of the parts were ground and then reprocessed under the same conditions. In order to get a proper combinational ratio of virgin and recycled ABS with respect to shrinkage and mechanical properties, another experiment was designed. In order to do this, virgin material was blended with 20%, 35% and 50% of the recycled material. The blends were reprocessed and samples were obtained. Impact, tensile, flexural and shrinkage tests, selected from ASTM standard, were used to investigate the mechanical properties of the polymer as well as its shrinkage. Furthermore, viscosity test was used to investigate the changes in the structure of the polymer. As the reprocessing cycles increased, shrinkage decreased and tensile and flexural ultimate strengths increased, more in flexural strength than in tensile. While Young's modulus slightly increased, viscosity decreased and consequently molecular weight decreased too. The proper blend for the least shrinkage was 50% whereas the best mechanical properties were achievable by the 20% blend. The obtained results suggest that reprocessing causes polymer degradation which is a result of the break in the bonds of poly butadiene. Moreover, it can be concluded that reprocessing in ABS can lead to the loss of effectiveness of some additives. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To meet the stacking layer-by-layer requirements, the fresh materials should have sufficient strength to ensure there is no collapse and plastic flow during the printing process. In addition, the fresh materials should exhibit enough stiffness to resist the intolerable elastic deformation to ensure printing accuracy. Since most of the printed structures have large height-to-thickness ratios, stabilities of printed structures should be taken into account. In this study, we investigated the rheological properties of 3D printed recycled coarse aggregate concrete (RAC), including their rheological behaviors when subjected to shear, the growth pattern of yield stress and shear modulus with resting time. Based on rheological parameters, buildability of RAC with 0%, 50% and 100% replacement rates were evaluated from the perspectives of strength, deformation and stability. It was found that yield stress of RAC exponentially increased with resting time, while the shear modulus linearly increased with resting time. Furthermore, within the first 15 min of printing, RAC exhibited better buildability with increasing replacement rate, however, the open time was shortened. In addition, the relationship between flowability and yield stress of the printing material was evaluated. Compared to the linear relationship of mortar, the relationship between flowability and yield stress was found to be exponential in RAC.

J	Friege, H				Friege, Henning			Sustainable Chemistry - A concept with important links to waste management	SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY			English	Review						Sustainable Chemistry; Waste reduction; Hazardous waste; Chemical leasing; Sustainable development goals; Recovery of resources	MODEL	Sustainable Chemistry is an overarching concept encompassing the design, manufacture and use of efficient, effective, safe and more environmentally benign chemical products and processes. With respect to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2015), the Sustainable Chemistry concept may serve as an important tool to reach these objectives including a high number of targets for chemicals and waste management. Sustainable Chemistry might become a valuable contribution to present waste management issues: Recycling of waste and recovery of resources from waste fractions are often severely restricted by the chemical composition of used products. These restrictions include components, which turned out to be hazardous, mixed materials like plastics with numerous additives, composite materials, which cannot be separated properly like plastics/wood, or low concentrated scarce metals in electronic devices. Following the concept of Sustainable Chemistry, - higher resource efficiency and increasing use of waste-derived renewable resources without endangering food production, - use of substances, which are not only less toxic but also better degradable under natural conditions ("benign by design"), - design of products which allow recycling by avoidance of inseparable combinations of materials and firmly fixed modules ("design for recycling"), might be achieved. The paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of integrating waste management issues into the concept of Sustainable Chemistry to avoid further unilateral technical solutions, which do not take re-use or recovery of resources into account.

The "3 R" (reduce, reuse, and recycle) scheme is adopted by many communities for efficiently recovering waste products and utilizing them for the production of energy. In the present work, the laboratory waste is collected and directly utilized for fabricating a laboratory waste-based triboelectric nanogenerator (LW-TENG) operating in vertical contact-separation mode. The substrate, electrode, and triboelectric layer are randomly selected from lab waste. The waste plastic petri dishes were extruded into thin filament wires for 3D printing of the substrate for the LW-TENG. The effective electrical output is generated by LW-TENG having a triboelectric layer plastic-glass delivering voltage of 185 V, current of 1.25 mu A, and power density of 8.1 mu W/ cm2 across the load resistance of 500 M omega. The positive and negative triboelectric layers are altered and the electrical output is systematically investigated. Additionally, the LW-TENG device is attached to various locations of the laboratory to demonstrate the energy harvesting from the mechanical motions. It is also utilized for demonstrating real-time applications that could be beneficial as a self-powered human tracking device (HSD) that tracks the location of the human during an emergency and self-powered exercise counter.

However, inconsistencies in the part properties due to the presence of defects in as-built components have hindered the widespread adoption of L-PBF for industrial applications motivating researchers to study the sources of variation for quality control purposes. A critical area suspected of creating variation in the part properties is the feedstock, where batch-to-batch differences as well as changes in the powder properties with reuse have the potential to affect performance. During processing, laser spatter and condensate form and deposit into the powder-bed surrounding the built parts. These particulates, collectively known as ejecta, differ morphologically and chemically from the virgin powder, potentially compromising reusability. In this study, 304L stainless steel powder was recycled for a total of 5 times through a systematic approach aimed at accelerating powder reuse to reveal its influence on both the tensile properties and impact toughness. Through analysis of variance (ANOVA), it was found that tensile properties did not change with reuse, while the impact toughness showed a steady decline revealing the differences in static and dynamic part properties due to powder reuse.

A life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out according to the methodology proposed by the international standards of the series ISO 14040. The performance of concrete mixes having a similar design compressive strength was evaluated. Results showed that the inclusion of steel fibers (SF) led to an increase in the global warming potential (GWP), whereas mixes with cement replacement by fly ash, slag, or microsilica recorded a reduction in GWP. Furthermore, SF-reinforced mixes created with 100% RA were at least three times more expensive than the NA-based control mix, while the cost of those with cement replacement by mineral additives was generally similar to that of the control. Material transportation was found to be a main contributor to the environmental and economic impacts, only second to cement, and its contribution increased with longer distances and steel fiber incorporation and decreased with RA replacement. To integrate these individual measures and select optimum mixes for various applications, multifunctional performance indices were developed. Research findings highlight the possibility to fully replace NA with RA (100%) while maintaining the performance and improving the economic and environmental impacts of concrete produced in the UAE.

A mixture of 90% cassava bagasse and 10% of Kraft paper was used for the production of these composites. Kraft paper was added as a source of long fibres, in order to improve the mechanical properties of the material. The prepared material has similar characteristics to the molded fibre packaging made using recycled paper, as used in egg boxes. However, cassava bagasse has advantages over recycled paper, in view of the fact that it is obtained from known and renewable sources. The impregnated and non-impregnated materials were submitted to tests of tensile strength and to direct contact with water by complete immersion of the samples. The cassava bagasse-Kraft paper composites obtained had a slight resistance to direct contact with water. The water mass absorbed by the materials impregnated with starch acetate was approximately half that of the materials without impregnation. However, the impregnation had little influence on the tensile strength of the tested samples. Starch acetate is therefore an attractive additive for use in the manufacture of waterproof materials, such as disposable trays. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Blanco, I; Siracusa, V				Blanco, Ignazio; Siracusa, Valentina			The Use of Thermal Techniques in the Characterization of Bio-Sourced Polymers	MATERIALS			English	Review						bio-polymers; thermal behaviour; recycling; thermal properties; sustainability		The public pressure about the problems derived from the environmental issues increasingly pushes the research areas, of both industrial and academic sectors, to design material architectures with more and more foundations and reinforcements derived from renewable sources. In these efforts, researchers make extensive and profound use of thermal analysis. Among the different techniques available, thermal analysis offers, in addition to high accuracy in the measurement, smartness of execution, allowing to obtain with a very limited quantity of material precious information regarding the property-structure correlation, essential not only in the production process, but overall, in the design one. Thus, techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), differential thermal analysis (DTA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were, are, and will be used in this transition from fossil feedstock to renewable ones, and in the development on new manufacturing processes such as those of additive manufacturing (AM). In this review, we report the state of the art of the last two years, as regards the use of thermal techniques in biopolymer design, polymer recycling, and the preparation of recyclable polymers as well as potential tools for biopolymer design in AM. For each study, we highlight how the most known thermal parameters, namely glass transition temperature (T-g), melting temperature (T-f), crystallization temperature (T-c) and percentage (%c), initial decomposition temperature (T-i), temperature at maximum mass loss rate (T-m), and tan delta, helped the researchers in understanding the characteristics of the investigated materials and the right way to the best design and preparation.

Rheology is a technique that has been used to assess the flowability of powders in different applications. In order to use the technique fir AM quality control and certification, it is essential to validate how sensitive the measurements are to particle characteristics and assess the relevance, repeatability and robustness of the method. The objectives of this interlaboratory study were to determine how the theology of SS-316L powder was affected by repeated use in a laser-beam powder-bed-fusion machine, evaluate if theology could be used to differentiate the behavior of virgin and recycled powders, and determine if the flow behavior correlates with other powder characteristics. The study was concluded blind using four samples of a SS-316L powder that were labeled Samples A, B, C, and D. All that the participants knew about the samples was their composition, that they had a particle-size distribution suitable for PBP-LB processing, and that they represented virgin and recycled feedstock. After the tests were completed, it was revealed that Samples B and D were virgin feedstock from the same powder lot, Sample A was a feedstock that had been reused eight times in a laser-beam powder-bed-fission machine (recycled), and Sample C was a 50:50 blend of the virgin and recycled powders. The results show that it was possible to identify the two identical powders and to differentiate the recycled powder from the virgin ones. This differentiation was possible despite the fact that the modifications of the powder were very small, as suggested by the fad that they were difficult to differentiate using other standard methods and still had adequate build performance after reuse. Globally, the BFE showed a relatively good capability to study the impact of recycling on powder behavior. However, absolute values differed significantly from lab to lab. The origin of these variations should be further investigated, and strategies should be identified to reduce them. Development of standard procedures should contribute to improving the reliability of the approach.

The MBM must be safely stored or treated. Most often meat and bone meal undergoes thermal treatment. During combustion large quantities of residues (ashes) are received, the recycled use of which has been given a lot of attention lately. In this work it was investigated the impact of the additive of the bottom ash (BA) formed during combustion of the MBM on the properties of forming mass and ceramic body of hydromica clay, and also it was evaluated a possibility to use the MBM BA in manufacturing of building ceramics. After replacing the sand in porous ceramics by this additive the plasticity of the forming mass, drying and firing shrinkage as well as density of ceramic body changed insignificantly whereas the compressive strength increased by 8 % - 22 %. So the MBM BA can be utilized in production of porous ceramics.

Reuse of fines from ready-mix concrete washing slurries	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Concrete slurry; Cementitious fines; Water reuse; Ready-mix concrete	RECYCLED AGGREGATE; LIFE-CYCLE; D WASTE; CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; PLANTS; EFFICIENCY; REDUCTION; SLUDGE; WATER	Concrete waste slurries coming from the washing of concrete mixer trucks in the manufacture of ready-mix concrete generate high costs and environmental impacts. In this work, we examined the consumption of raw materials, water, and generation of wastes for three Brazilian ready-mix concrete plants (that used different waste management strategies). The reuse of concrete slurry fines was also investigated in new concretes considering the waste management scenarios, production and operational costs. The strategy to recover fresh concrete provided the best scenario since it reduced significantly operational costs, despite the inclusion of new production cost, i.e. the hydration stabilizer additive. The replacement of sand with 1 vol.% concrete slurry provided adequate rheological conditions for concretes, when the water content increased up to 6 wt.% or added 0.3 % m.c. of polycarboxylate-based additive. The marginal increase in the production cost can also be compensated by the reduction of the disposal operational costs. The reuse strategy was not enough for the total elimination of concrete fines, requiring market diversification (e.g. pre-cast concrete products); but fines availability can be very limited.

Among them, water-based cutting fluid accounts for more than 90% of the consumption of cutting fluid. However, long-term recycling of water-based cutting fluid could easily cause deterioration, and the breeding of bacteria could cause the cutting fluid to fail, increase manufacturing costs, and even endanger the health of workers. Traditional bactericides could improve the biological stability of cutting fluids, but they are toxic to the environment and do not conform to the development trend of low-carbon manufacturing. Low-carbon manufacturing is inevitable and the direction of sustainable manufacturing. The use of nanomaterials, transition metal complexes, and physical sterilization methods on the bacterial cell membrane and genetic material could effectively solve this problem. In this article, the mechanism of action of additives and microbial metabolites was first analyzed. Then, the denaturation mechanism of traditional bactericides on the target protein and the effect of sterilization efficiency were summarized. Further, the mechanism of nanomaterials disrupting cell membrane potential was discussed. The effects of lipophilicity and the atomic number of transition metal complexes on cell membrane penetration were also summarized, and the effects of ultraviolet rays and ozone on the destruction of bacterial genetic material were reviewed. In other words, the bactericidal performance, hazard, degradability, and economics of various sterilization methods were comprehensively evaluated, and the potential development direction of improving the biological stability of cutting fluid was proposed.

The ecological mortar design involves the dosing of Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) slag, together with finely ground Polyurethane Foam, cement, and additives. An energy efficient prefabricated block is designed with the mortar, for use in construction, and its energy performance is assessed as a material inserted within the envelope of a service sector (hospital) building, either as an exterior skin, or as an enclosing component within the facade interior. The main contribution of this research is the characterization of the thermo-physical and mechanical properties of a new prefabricated panel made with recycled materials. The full characterization of the properties of these new materials is presented and discussed. The new prefabricated panel demonstrates adequate thermo-mechanical characteristics as a substitute for traditional materials, while improving the sustainability of the building. As a secondary objective, the energy behaviour of the new panels when integrated in a real building is presented by means of a case study simulation. The use of computational thermal simulation confirmed that the properties of the prefabricated block influenced the annual thermal demand of the building for heating and cooling. Improvements to the thermal inertia of the building envelope were also confirmed with the inclusion of PF waste, giving the mortar an energy performance that was similar to conventional materials, in such a way that its use in facade construction may be validated, in addition to its environmental benefits, due to it having been manufactured with critical recycled industrial waste such as EAF slag and PF, thereby contributing to both the circular economy and sustainable development.

The 3d printed catalyst showed similar activity to that of the pristine powdery commercial catalyst, but with improved practical recoverability and reduced leaching of palladium into solution. Recycling of the printed catalyst led to increase of the induction period of the reactions, attributed to the pseudo-homogeneous catalysis. The reaction is initiated by oxidative addition of aryl iodide to palladium nanoparticles, resulting in formation of soluble molecular species, which then act as the homogeneous catalyst. SLS 3d printing improves handling, overall practicality and recyclability of the catalyst without altering the chemical behaviour of the active component.

The potential use of cement-asbestos waste in the ceramic masses destined for sintered wall clay brick manufacture	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Sintering; Clays; Traditional ceramics; Asbestos-cement utilization	THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION; CHRYSOTILE; INERTIZATION; TEMPERATURE; PRODUCT	Asbestos fibers are considered to be carcinogenic and to cause cancer, thus elimination of asbestos-containing materials from the environment is necessary. Currently, asbestos materials are stored in special landfills designed for hazardous wastes. However, this procedure is not a final solution to the problem and an alternative might be thermal recycling. This paper reports the results of a study on using asbestos-cement slates as an additive to ceramic masses that are typical in the manufacture of sintered clinker wall bricks. Green compacts containing various amounts (0-10 wt%) of asbestos-cement wastes were sintered at temperatures of 1100-1200 degrees C. Subsequently, ceramic product properties such as water absorption, open porosity, apparent density, compressive strength and freeze resistance were determined. The preliminary results of the study indicate that asbestos-containing materials can be used as one of the raw materials in the manufacture of clinker ceramic material, and that the origin of the asbestos-cement used does not have a significant influence on the basic properties of sintered clinker wall bricks Main ceramic properties, such as water absorption, compressive strength and freeze resistance, comply with national standards and requirements for construction and road clinker ceramic.

The improved process redirects one recycle stream, uses a. stripping column instead of a flash tank to recover isobutylene, and uses a rectifying column instead of a distillation column to purify the product. Economic analysis Shows that the improved process has a 22% lower total annual cost (TAC) than the best known process published in the literature. Significant increases in the selectivity of the overall process from 84.7% to 99.3% can also be realized by comparing the optimized improved design versus the original design Dynamic simulations were also conducted and indicated that stringent product specification can be met with a simple decentralized, feedback control structure despite impurities in the feed streams and also changes in the throughput.

WOOD CHILE PEPPERS STALKS-PLASTIC COMPOSITE PRODUCTION	MADERAS-CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA			English	Article						Chile pepper stems; Pinus resinosa; tensile properties; water absorption; wood plastic composite		Nowadays, most common wood fibers used to produce wood plastic composites are from Oak and pine trees, rice hull, recycled paper, pallets and post-industrial oak fiber, furniture waste, or cedar wood chips. This paper is focused on a new wood plastic composites based on pre-dried New Mexico red chile stems and leafs with high-density polyethylene. The specimens were manufactured following ASTM 638-9 standard using injection molding. A series of experiments were designed to investigate how wood fiber length, geometry, and water absorption affects the microcellular structure of the new sustainable material. The effects of proportions and particle size on the strength of the resulting blend were analyzed. It was found that larger particle sizes of wood fiber showed higher mechanical properties. The blending of additives in the new sustainable material has shown to increase proper fiber dispersion improving the strength of the material.

However, robust global information, particularly about their end-of-life fate, is lacking. By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately 6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9% of which had been recycled, 12% was incinerated, and 79% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.

Mn-ZnO-based reinforcement, known for its functional properties, has been utilized to tune the thermo-mechanical, morphological, and piezoelectric characteristics of LPDE. Functional feedstock filaments have been manufactured by varying twin screw compounder processing parameters such as barrel temperature (120, 130, and 140 degrees C), screw torque (0.15, 0.20, and 0.20 N.m) and forced loading (5, 10 and 15 kg). The results of the study suggested that the better mechanical properties of feedstock filament were attained at 140 degrees C barrel temperature, 0.25 N.m screw torque, and 10kg forced loading in TSE. The result of the tensile properties is supported by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), piezoelectric property (D-33 measurement), shape memory effect and differential scanning calorimetric analysis.

REVIEW: THE VALUE OF WOOD EXTRACTIVES FROM PINUS RADIATA	APPITA			English	Review						Wood resins; natural products; softwoods; thermo-mechanical pulp; bioactivity	TALL OIL; PHASE DISTRIBUTION; FATTY-ACIDS; ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY; COLLOIDAL SUBSTANCES; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT; DECAY RESISTANCE; SOUTHERN PINE; RESIN ACIDS; TMP RESIN	The wood extractives from softwood species, which include resin acids, fatty acids and triglycerides, have useful properties making them valuable as natural products. Their water repellency, adhesive properties and biological activity make them useful in manufacturing, agriculture and medicine with broader applications expected to be developed in the future with a shift toward renewable resources. These wood extractives can be problematic in paper manufacture as they cause deposits on machinery and in the paper products, which requires higher levels of maintenance, limits water recycling, increases wastewater toxicity and can reduce product quality. Current methods for addressing these problems in thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) and paper mills include treatment of wood to reduce extractives content prior to pulping, tighter control of processes to prevent formation of deposits, and the use of additives to fix extractives into the paper product. Recovery of the wood extractives from the process water in a reasonably pure form would provide new value-added products turning a once troublesome material into something of value for existing pulp and paper mills.

Glass reinforced thermoplastics (GRT) offer economic efficiency, a high process reproducibility, short cycle times, a stable and high component quality and a good recyclability. The direct strand-deposition process is capable to increase the efficiency of manufacturing GRT parts by omitting the step of producing expensive semi-finished compounds. A high flexibility can be achieved by an easy variation of fiber lengths and contents or by using other matrix materials than polypropylene and different additives. This paper presents the direct strand-deposition process. Optimum process parameters are determined mainly to reduce fiber length reduction. Mechanical properties, flowability aspects and fiber-length distribution and orientation in the part are characterized. With this, the process and achievable properties can be compared to traditional processing techniques of long-fiber reinforced thermoplastics. This process is also capable to recycle cutting waste and scrap efficiently while maintaining long fibers.

However, there is a lack of studies about the influence that each of these technologies has on the main areas of action covered by the circular economy. This study responds to this gap by investigating the influence of the major technologies: Additive Manufacturing, Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Vision, Big Data and Advanced Analytics, Cybersecurity, Internet of Things, Robotics, and Virtual and Augmented Reality on the main areas of action covered by the circular economy. Namely, reduction of inputs consumption, reuse, recovery, recycling and reduction of waste and emissions. An initial study, based on a survey of 120 project managers, and a multiple case study of 27 projects, through 31 personal interviews and review of internal and external documentation have been conducted in order to investigate the real influence of each technology on the circular economy. Overall, the results confirm the existence of a wide range of influences that Industry 4.0 technologies offer to companies for improved circularity. These improvements are mainly related to reduce material and energy consumption, and waste and emissions generation. However, there are important differences between the potential impacts of each technology. In particular, there is most evidence of the positive impact of additive manufacturing and robotics. Likewise, the results obtained suggest the need to continue exploring the new impacts generated by the continuous development and integration of technologies.

Low-Volume Road WMA Mixtures: Moisture Susceptibility of Mixtures Containing Coal Ash and Roofing Shingle with Moist Aggregate	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Roofing shingles; Coal ash; Indirect tensile strength; Aged index; Moist aggregate; Warm mix asphalt		The objective of this study was to evaluate the laboratory moisture susceptibility of low-volume hot mix asphalt (HMA) and warm mix asphalt (WMA) mixtures containing moist aggregates and recycled materials, such as manufactured roofing shingles and coal ash material. These materials were tested after short-and long-term aging procedures. The test properties of these mixtures included indirect tensile strength (ITS), the tensile strength ratio (TSR), and the flow value of virgin and aged specimens. The experimental design included two percentages of coal ash (10 and 5% by weight of the aggregate), two roofing shingle contents (5 and 3% by weight of the aggregate), three WMA additives (Asphamin, Sasobit, and Evotherm), two antistripping agents (hydrated lime and one liquid antistripping agent), and two aggregate sources. A total of 72 mixtures were designed and a total of 416 ITS specimens were tested for short-and long-term aged procedures in this study. The test results indicated that the dry and wet ITS values of low-volume mixtures containing moist aggregate generally satisfied the demand of pavement without requiring additional treatment. Mixtures containing hydrated lime, in general, showed a better moisture resistance than liquid ASA for WMA mixtures. Moreover, the addition of WMA additives in the low-volume mixture was effective and generally showed a similar moisture resistance to HMA, except for when using Asphamin and liquid ASA simultaneously. Research results also indicated that the utilization of recycled coal ash and roofing shingles significantly improved moisture resistance of HMA and WMA mixtures.

The effects of solvent, dissolution temperature and time and cooling method and speed on the particle size and morphologies of the prepared nylon elastomer powder are investigated. Design/methodology/approach The prepared nylon elastomer power possesses the particle size of around 50 mm and is spherical in shape, indicating that this study provides the feasible dissolution-precipitation process, a distillation cooling method and a suitable solvent to prepare nylon elastomer powders. Findings Compared to pure nylon 12, the nylon elastomer has a lower part bed temperature and a wider sintering window for the SLS process. The wider sintering window indicates the better SLS processibility. The lower part bed temperature is beneficial to the recycling of material and the decrease in the requirement of SLS equipment.

Distributed Manufacturing of Flexible Products: Technical Feasibility and Economic Viability	TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						distributed manufacturing; additive manufacturing; 3-D printing; consumer; economics; flexible materials; open-source; thermoplastic elastomer; thermoplastic polyurethane	LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS; ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN; POLYMER; CONSUMERS; REPRAP; INNOVATION; PRINTERS; WASTE; SCALE	Distributed manufacturing even at the household level is now well established with the combined use of open source designs and self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers. Previous work has shown substantial economic consumer benefits for producing their own polymer products. Now flexible filaments are available at roughly 3-times the cost of more conventional 3-D printing materials. To provide some insight into the potential for flexible filament to be both technically feasible and economically viable for distributed digital manufacturing at the consumer level this study investigates 20 common flexible household products. The 3-D printed products were quantified by print time, electrical energy use and filament consumption by mass to determine the cost to fabricate with a commercial RepRap 3-D printer. Printed parts were inspected and when necessary tested for their targeted application to ensure technical feasibility. Then, the experimentally measured cost to DIY manufacturers was compared to low and high market prices for comparable commercially available products. In addition, the mark-up and potential for long-term price declines was estimated for flexible filaments by converting thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) pellets into filament and reground TPE from a local recycling center into filament using an open source recyclebot. This study found that commercial flexible filament is economically as well as technically feasible for providing a means of distributed home-scale manufacturing of flexible products. The results found a 75% savings when compared to the least expensive commercially equivalent products and 92% when compared to high market priced products. Roughly, 160 flexible objects must be substituted to recover the capital costs to print flexible materials. However, as previous work has shown the Lulzbot Mini 3-D printer used in this study would provide more than a 100% ROI printing one object a week from hard thermoplastics, the upgrade needed to provide flexible filament capabilities can be accomplished with 37 average substitution flexible prints. This, again easily provides a triple digit return on investment printing one product a week. Although these savings, which are created by printing objects at home are substantial, the results also have shown the savings could be further increased to 93% when the use of a pellet extruder and TPE pellets, and 99% if recycled TPE filament made with a recyclebot is used. The capital costs of a recyclebot can be recovered in the manufacturing of about 9 kg of TPE filament, which can be accomplished in less than a week, enabling improved environmental impact as well as a strong financial return for heavy 3-D printer users.

Additive manufacturing of continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites using fused deposition modelling: Effect of process parameters on mechanical properties	COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						3D printing; Fused deposition modelling; Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites; Mechanical characterization; Process parameters; Failure analysis	CONTINUOUS CARBON-FIBER; POLYMER COMPOSITES; 3D; PLA; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT; FABRICATION; RESISTANCE; GLASS	Continuous Fibre Reinforced Thermoplastic Composites (CFRTPCs) are becoming alternative materials to replace the conventional thermosetting polymers and metals due to excellent mechanical performance, recycling and potential used in lightweight structures. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a promising additive manufacturing technology and an alternative of conventional processes for the fabrication of CFRTPCs due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. The mechanical properties of a built part depend on several process parameters. The aim of this study is to characterize the effect of build orientation, layer thickness and fibre volume content on the mechanical performance of 3D printed continuous fibre reinforced composites components manufactured by a desktop 3D printer. Tensile and three-point bending tests are carried out to determine the mechanical response of the printed specimens. SEM images of fractured surfaces are evaluated to determine the effects of process parameters on failure modes. It is observed that the effect of layer thickness of nylon samples on the mechanical performance is marginally significant. In addition, continuous fibre reinforced samples show higher strength and stiffness values than unreinforced ones. The results show that carbon fibre reinforced composites exhibit the best mechanical performance with higher stiffness and flat samples exhibit higher values of strength and stiffness than on-edge samples. Additionally, the results show that strength and stiffness increase as fibre volume content increases in most cases but, conversely, the level of increment in mechanical performance is moderate with continued rise in fibre content, particularly in the case of Kevlar (R) and glass fibres, due to weak bonding between the fibre/nylon layers as well as the presence of increased levels of defects. Finally, the practicality of the results is assessed by testing an evaluation structure.	[Chacon, J. M.; Reverte, J.

CYCLAM - Recycling by a laser-driven drop jet from waste that feeds AM	16TH NORDIC LASER MATERIALS PROCESSING CONFERENCE, NOLAMP16	Physics Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	16th Nordic Laser Materials Processing Conference (NOLAMP)	AUG 22-24, 2017	Aalborg, DENMARK	Aalborg Univ, Dept Mat & Prod		LAM; 3D-printing; metal; imaging; cutting	SPATTER; FRONT; ANGLE; WIRE	Additive manufacturing of metal parts is supplied by powder or wire. Manufacturing of this raw material causes additional costs and environmental impact. A new technique is proposed where the feeding directly originates from a metal sheet, which can even be waste. When cutting is done by laser-induced boiling, melt is continuously ejected downwards underneath the sheet. The ejected melt is deposited as a track on a substrate, enabling additive manufacturing by substrate movement along a desired path. The melt first flows downwards as a column and after a few millimeters separates into drops, here about 500 micrometer in diameter, as observed by high speed imaging. The drops incorporate sequentially and calmly into a long melt pool on the substrate. While steel drops formed regular tracks on steel and aluminium substrates, on copper substrate periodic drops solidified instead. For this new technique, called CYCLAM, the laser beam acts indirectly while the drop jet becomes the main tool. From imaging, properties like the width or fluctuations of the drop jet can be statistically evaluated. Despite oscillation of the liquid column, the divergence of the drop jet remained small, improving the precision and robustness. The melt leaves the cut sheet as a liquid column, 1 to 4 mm in length, which periodically separates drops that are transferred as a liquid jet to the substrate. For very short distance of 2 to 3 mm between the two sheets this liquid column can transfer the melt continuously as a liquid bridge. This phenomenon was observed, as a variant of the technique, but the duration of the bridge was limited by fluid mechanic instabilities. (C) 2017 The authors. Published by Elsevier B.Y.

This leads to an increment in the volume of waste, including hard-to-degrade keratin-rich ones, such as feathers. Currently, most of the agro-industrial complex protein by-products are utilized by incineration, landfilling, and chemical hydrolysis. Such methods do not meet modern trends in the development of a sustainable economy, negatively affecting the environment and humans, and preventing the reusing of waste. An alternative is biodegradation, which consists of the application of living organisms and their enzymes to recycle by-products. This approach is not only sustainable, but also makes it possible to obtain products of waste hydrolysis that are in demand for the manufacture of fertilizers and feed additives. This brings the development of agriculture closer to a circular economy and makes the recycling process more profitable. This review article emphasizes the significance of keratinolytic microorganisms and keratinases for the improvement of green methods for processing hard-to-degrade protein waste of the agro-industrial complex, which is necessary for sustainable economic development.

Thermomechanical investigations of SiC and Al2O3-reinforced HDPE	JOURNAL OF THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; recycled polymer; high-density polyethylene; fused deposition modeling; rapid tooling; thermomechanical	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; WASTE; LDPE	This research work highlights the thermomechanical investigations of silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3)-reinforced high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-based feed stock filament of commercial fused deposition modeling (FDM) setup. The recycled HDPE waste was collected (from domestic waste) and washed with water jet for removal of contamination in the first stage. After contamination removal, rheological and thermal behavior (melt flow index, melting temperature, decomposition and enthalpy, etc.) of the unreinforced and reinforced polymer matrix was observed. The SiC and Al2O3 reinforcements in the HDPE matrix have been controlled by twin-screw extrusion process, followed by its processing on single-screw extrusion for preparation of FDM feed stock filament. The feed stock filament prepared by single-screw extruder was subjected to tensile test for mechanical properties (such as peak strength, peak load, and Young's modulus). After ascertaining mechanical properties, multifactor optimization has been performed. Finally, scanning electron micrographs were obtained to understand the distribution of ceramic particles. This study highlights the detailed procedure for managing the polymer waste with improved mechanical properties by considering multifactor optimization. This will enhance the sustainability and also helps to develop low-cost, in-house FDM filament for possible applications as rapid tooling.	[Singh, Narinder; Ahuja, I. P.

Amongst the chemicals added to PVC are metal-based stabilisers and Sb-based halogenated flame retardant synergists. However, very little quantitative information exists on these additives, and in particular in PVC lost to the environment. In this study, the distribution of PVC amongst consumer plastics in societal circulation and plastics retrieved from marine and lacustrine beaches and agricultural soils are compared, along with the presence and concentrations of Ba, Cd, Pb, Sb, Sn and Zn as proxies for common metal-based additives and determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. About 10% of consumer plastics and 2% of environmental plastics were constructed of PVC, with the discrepancy attributed to the long service lives and managed disposal of PVC used in the construction sector and the propensity of the plastic to sink in aquatic systems and evade detection. Metal-based additives, defined as having a metal concentration >1000 mg kg(-1), were present in about 75% of consumer and environmental PVC, with Ba and Pb most abundant and Cd and Zn least abundant in both types of sample, and median concentrations statistically different only for Ba. Metals also appeared to be present as contaminants (defined as concentrations <1000 mg kg(-1)) arising from manufacturing or recycling. Metals in PVC are believed to pose little risk when the material is in use, but experimental evidence in the literature suggests that significant mobilisation and exposure may occur from PVC microplastics when ingested by wildlife.

Progress on the Use of an Information-Technology-Based Method in Low-Waste Technologies for Aluminum Production	METALLURGIST			English	Article						waste-free technologies; physicochemical models; electrolysis; fluorine compounds; recycling of raw materials		The use of information-technology-based methods is substantiated and a method based on systems analysis is developed with the use of computer models to optimize the conditions and parameters of the operations in aluminum production. The method of minimizing the Gibbs free energy of a thermodynamic system is used to create an algorithm which determines the order of metastable equilibrium of the components in the production process and the dynamics of the mobile heterogeneous phases. The physicochemical laws that govern structural changes in the composition of the condensed phases and the equilibrium phases are examined in relation to the cryolite ratio (NaF/AlF3). The results make it possible to correct the cryolitealumina melt (electrolyte) and predict the volume of emissions and waste products. A method of measuring and stabilizing the characteristic temperatures is also developed. The optimum conditions and parameters for the use of fluoride salts (fluoroaluminates) and the recycling of fluorine compounds and impurities in "dry" gas-cleaning and electrolysis are determined. Fluorine-bearing wastes are grouped in three different classes based on the proportions of the main phases and the impurities that are present. Thermochemical methods are proposed for their waste-free processing to obtain additional products and process additives that can serve as valuable components in the production of alumina and aluminum. Improved technologies for cleaning gases and recycling wastes can help make more thorough use of raw materials and reduce emissions of harmful substances during aluminum manufacturing.

J	Li, BG; Zheng, Y; Pan, ZL; Hartsough, B				Li, Baoguo; Zheng, Yi; Pan, Zhongli; Hartsough, Bruce			Improved properties of medium-density particleboard manufactured from saline Creeping Wild Rye and HDPE plastic	INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS			English	Article						Creeping Wild Rye; High-density polyethylene; Mechanical strength; Water resistance particleboard; Polymeric methane diphenyl diisocyanate; Rice bran adhesive	WHEAT-STRAW; RICE BRAN; ADHESIVE; WOOD; FIBERBOARD; STRENGTH; PROTEIN; BOARDS; RESIN	Creeping Wild Rye (CWR), Leymus triticoides, is a salt-tolerant perennial grass used for mitigating the problems of saltilization and alkalization in drainage irrigation water and soil to minimize potential pollution of water streams. In this study, CWR was used as a raw material to manufacture medium-density particleboard. The objective of this research was to characterize the mechanical and water resistance properties of CWR particleboards bonded by four different adhesive levels and compositions, including 4% polymeric methane diphenyl diisocyanate (PMDI), 2.8% PMDI. [1.2% rice bran adhesive (RBA) + 2.8% PMDI] and [20% recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) + 2.8% PMDI]. In addition, orthogonal experimental design was employed to optimize three factors (hot-press temperature, HDPE particle size and HDPE content) to achieve desired mechanical and water resistance properties of particleboards bonded by a mixture adhesive. The evaluated mechanical properties of particleboards were tensile strength (TS), modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and internal bond (IB) strength. Water absorption (WA) and thickness swelling (THS) were measured to determine water resistance properties of the particleboards. Partially replacing PMDI with RBA did not compromise mechanical quality, but deteriorated water resistance properties. The results showed that 30% of PMDI can be replaced by adding 20% HDPE, resulting in particleboard with higher mechanical strength and water resistance than particleboard made without HDPE. It has been concluded that HDPE from recycled plastic bags could be used as an adhesive or additive to partially replace PMDI for making high-quality particleboards. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Recycling of by-product is one of the effective solutions of its disposal problem. The paper describes an investigation of the hydration behavior of a phosphogypsum with zeolite (hydrosodalite) addition using ultrasound treatment. Two ultrasound treatment durations: 0.5 min and 2 min were used. It was found that hydrosodalite is an effective adsorption additive for acidic contaminants (solvable P2O5 and F) present in phosphogypsum, which allows regulating the phosphogypsum hydration and setting time. The compressive strength of samples containing 5% hydrosodalite and with 2 min sonication is 35% higher, than the compressive strength of samples without additive and sonication. In this case, the positive effect of sonication and of hydrosodalite additive is combined. Phosphogypsum as a residue from the phosphate fertilizer industry is classified as a Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM). Therefore, when it is used as an additive component to building materials radioactivity content must be checked. The different amount of the various radionuclides within the natural radioactive decay series, such as that of Ra-226, Ra-228, Th-228, K-40, and Pb-210 were measured by high resolution gamma spectrometry. The results showed that activity concentration of natural radionuclides as Ra-226, Ra-228, Th-228,K- 40 are below the clearance limit and activity concentration indices calculated for all materials used for experiments met the existing criteria allowing to use them for construction purposes.

Biodegradable polymer materials and modifying additives: state of the art. Part II	NANOTECHNOLOGIES IN CONSTRUCTION-A SCIENTIFIC INTERNET-JOURNAL			English	Review						biodegradation; biodegradable additives; petrochemical raw materials; polymers; plasticizers; plant sources	COMPOSITES	One of the most demanded materials on the planet is plastic, the excellent performance of which contributes to the accumulationof a significant amount of waste on its basis. In this regard, a new approach to the development of these materials hasbeen formed in scientific circles: the production of polymer composites with constant performance characteristics for a certain-period and then capable of destruction under the influence of environmental factors. Analysis of the current state of the industry of polymeric materials shows that the most urgent is the use of such classical polymers as polyolefins and polyvinyl chloride. First of all, the optimal solution to this problem due to the lack of a suitable replacement for traditional polymers is the development of composites based on them with the use of biodegradable additives. In this case, a set of problems associated with waste disposal issolved: the decomposition period of the recycled waste is significantly reduced, the territories required for plastic waste are reduced. The paper outlines the preconditions for the emergence and further development of the field of biodegradable polymers. The mainquantitative characteristics of the production capacities of manufactured bioplastics by types, regions and industries of applicationare given. Modern methods of reducing and regulating the degradation time of polymer materials are presented. The main global and domestic manufacturers of biodegradable polymers and their products are listed, as well as a list of the main manufacturers of biodegradable additives for polymeric materials. Modern types of bioplastics based on renewable raw materials, composites with their use, aswell as modified materials from natural and synthetic polymers are listed. The main methods for determining the biodegradability of existing bioplastics are described.	[Mazitova, A. K.; Aminova, G. K.; Zaripov, I. I.; Vikhareva, I.

By disclosing strategies for their everyday operation, it is intended to show how the internal expertise acquired overtime copes with the lack of standards within this industry. Design/methodology/approach - The study was deployed by means of a survey including four main issues: RM concepts, process planning, materials and costs. Questions range from general RM perceptions to specific production criteria like: layer thicknesses, laser power, quality assurance methods, etc. A special emphasis is made on cost parameters, since they play a major role when selecting the final manufacturing route. Findings - The so-called "de facto standards" were found to be widely used in order to minimize production risks for RM. The study also suggests the need for specific RM standards based on key issues like material recycling, process planning and costs assignment. Practical implications - The study is mainly focused on additive RM processes used in Spanish centres. Although, some other technologies applied elsewhere might not be considered, it is assumed that most of the technologies mentioned in this study are available worldwide, thus providing valuable information to increase the general RM base of knowledge. Originality/value - Unlike most of the RM literature based on benchmarking of processes to provide information, this paper shows first hand data from users and service providers, showing RM practices and preferences from a different approach.

Through continuous research, many related works and patents have been produced, and then they are most widely used in the field of secondary batteries. However, in the actual production and application, it is found that LABs have the disadvantages of short cycle life, low specific energy, poor low temperature performance and easy corrosion, which greatly limits their application. In this paper, the current research status and main shortcomings of LABs are analyzed, and the related research work of improving the chemical properties of LABs in recent years are systematically reviewed from the aspects of grid composition and structure, lead paste formula, additives, curing and formation process, etc., which provides guidance and ideas for the preparation and engineering application of high-performance LABs, Finally, the challenges and future improvement technologies of LABs are prospected.

Polyamide 12 is the most commonly and successfully used polymer powders to date in SLS due to the conforming thermal behaviors of this thermoplastic polymer. State of the art technology produces a substantial amount of un-sintered powders after the manufacturing process. Failure to recycle and reuse these aged powders not only leads to economic losses but also is environmentally unfriendly. This is particularly problematic for powders close to the heat-affected zones that go through severe thermal degradations during the laser sintering processes. Limited procedures exist for systematically reusing such extremely aged powders. This work proposes a new process control method to maximize reusability of aged and extremely aged polyamide 12 powders. Building on a previously untapped interlayer heating, preprocessing, and mixing of powder materials, we show how reclaimed polyamide 12 powders can be consistently reprinted into functional samples, with mechanical properties even superior to current industrial norms. In particular, the proposed method can yield printed samples with 18.04 % higher tensile strength and 55.29 % larger elongation at break using as much as 30 % of extremely aged powders compared to the benchmark sample.

Assessment of the composition and the microstructure of aluminium-containing waste for the substantiation of the directions of its use	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			Russian	Article						aluminum-containing wastes; aluminium oxide; sludge; energy-dispersive microanalysis		Complex recycling of industrial wastes involves the extraction of valuable components and the use of waste as secondary material resources. Implementation of resource-saving technologies reduces the anthropogenic load on the environment. In the process of thermal destruction of calorific materials, waste with a high content of aluminum oxide is generated. In order to determine the directions of usage of alumina-containing waste the initial study of its composition and structure was made. The methods of scanning electron microscopy and quantitative physicochemical analysis were used. The following samples were studied: construction samples with waste additives (15 and 30%), and a series of samples purified with mineral acids and water. The mineral composition of the alumina waste corresponded to the requirements for raw materials for use as a reinforcing additive in cement mixtures, heat-resistant concretes and for the manufacture of binders. Compaction of the structure by spherical particles Al2O3 affects the strength characteristics of gypsum binder samples. A comparison is made between the physico-mechanical characteristics of samples with different waste content and control sample of gypsum. A study of the microstructure and element analysis of waste, purified by mineral acids, was made. The analysis showed an inhomogeneous composition of impurities. Treatment of waste with acids and water is effectively remove impurities, at the same time mass content of aluminum in the purified samples is increasing. The results of evaluation of waste structure and composition can be used for explanation of materials formation with new structure on aluminum-oxygen basis and ceramic materials formation that can be manufactured using this type of waste.

On the Morphology Changes of Al and Al-Cu Powder After Laser Melting	METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B-PROCESS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS PROCESSING SCIENCE			English	Article							SPATTER GENERATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; OXIDATION; ALUMINUM; BEHAVIOR; ALLOYS; STRENGTH; ALSI10MG; STEEL	Gas-atomized powders are commonly used in additive manufacturing, specifically laser powder bed fusion, due to their high flowability during recoating. Morphological changes can occur in particles that are irradiated by the laser during additive manufacturing, but are not incorporated into the melt pool. These irradiated particles will affect the rheology of the recycled powder in subsequent builds, potentially leading to failures due to uneven powder flow or spatial distribution. Thus, a better understanding of mechanisms that degrade the sphericity of powder after being laser irradiated is needed. This research examines morphological changes in Al and Al-Cu eutectic powders after laser melting. Two complementary approaches were taken. First, particles found along the edges of line scans following high-power (300 W) laser irradiation were characterized. The collected particles displayed morphological anomalies not observed in the as-received powder. Then, to gain a more quantitative and controlled perspective on morphological evolution, the same base powders were dispersed onto glass substrates and irradiated with a low-power (6.5 W) CW laser diode. This approach, which permits characterization of specific particles before and after laser irradiation, clearly shows laser-induced changes in the surface morphology of particles in the form of dents and rifts. These results suggest that isolated melting and resolidification of particles contained within their respective oxide shells can occur at the relatively low laser energy densities present at the edges of laser melt tracks. Thermal stresses developing in the oxide shell during cooling can account for the observed morphological changes in the context of shell-buckling theory.	[Skelton, J. M.; Headley, C., V; Sullivan, E.

Assessment of 3D printing using fused deposition modeling and selective laser sintering for a circular economy	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Circular Economy; Additive Manufacturing; 3D Printing; Recycling; SLS; FDM	ABS; DEGRADATION	Plastic today is commonplace. Products and parts made with plastic have short life cycles, ending up in landfills not long after manufacture. Finding new pathways for plastic waste has become a critical focus of sustainability efforts, especially within manufacturing. Thus, research in this field continues to grow in order to determine the feasibility of reclaiming post-consumer plastic for reuse. This paper evaluates the potential for a sustainable, circular pathway for end-of-life plastic material using 3D-printing techniques. To do this, the work investigates two prevalent industrial 3D-printing technologies: selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) of polymers. Material-flow and economic models are developed to outline how plastic parts at the end of their life cycle can be processed and reused. Prior works on fundamental material degradation are integrated into mathematical models of cost and operation. This enables mapping of how multiple reuse cycles affect two prevalent industrial polymers: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polyamide 12 (PA 12). The mapping identifies there is significant opportunity for improving both SLS and FDM 3D-printing technologies when it comes to economic viability and sustainability. Comparison between reuse of FDM using ABS and SLS using PA 12 shows the former costs 82% less than the latter, while also producing 87% less waste than it. While the study established that available industrial 3D-printing technologies can help to reduce plastic waste within manufacturing, a fully circular economy demands materials with less thermal degradation than the primary industrial 3D-printing polymers.

For better understanding the mechanism of the acid-base effect, the construction of in vitro model is undoubtedly a simple and interesting work to evaluate the influence. Here, a novel porous silica-based solid-acid catalyst material was prepared by additive manufacturing technology, exhibiting improved eliminating effects of the residue. SEM, FTIR, and TGA were used to characterize the morphology, structure, and thermal stability of the synthesized 3D material. The reaction between 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol and 3, 4-dihydro-2H-pyran was used as a template reaction to evaluate the eliminating performance of the 3D porous material. Solvents were optimized, and three reaction groups in the presence of 3D SiO2, 3D SiO2-SO3H, and 3D SiO2-NH-SO3H, as well as one without catalyst, were compared. In addition, in consideration of the complicated situation of the physiological environment in vivo, universality of the synthesized 3D SiO2-NH-SO3H catalyst material was studied with different alcohols. The results showed that the sulfonic acid-grafted 3D material had excellent catalytic performance, achieving a yield over 95% in only 20 min. Besides, the catalyst material can be recycled at least 10 times, with yields still higher than 90%. Such a solid catalyst material is expected to have great potential in additive manufacturing because the catalyst material is easy-recyclable, renewable and biocompatible. The 3D material with connective channels may also be utilized as an in vitro model for environment evaluation of osteochondral repair in the future.

Assessment of trapped powder removal and inspection strategies for powder bed fusion techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Post-processing; Inspection; Micro-CT	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TI-6AL-4V; DESIGN; LASER; ATOMIZATION; FABRICATION; PARAMETERS; IMPLANTS	The issue of trapped powder within a part made using powder bed fusion additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the 'dirty secrets' of AM, yet it has not received significant attention by the research community. Trapped powders limit the application of AM for complex geometries, including heat exchangers and dies with conformal cooling channels. Being able to detect and remove trapped powder from the build is a necessary step to avoid downstream processing and performance challenges. In this work, 'powder challenge geometries' with complex internal features were fabricated via laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and electron beam selective melting (EBSM) and were used to assess the effectiveness of several powder removal and inspection methods. Hand-held ultrasonic polishing was explored as a powder removal technique and was shown to effectively clear extremely elongated channels that grit-blasting (the current industry standard) cannot clear. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) and weighing were used to inspect and quantitatively assess the effectiveness of powder removal techniques on the challenge geometries. Using the lesser known 'vacuum boiling' powder removal process and the more common ultrasonic bathing process, trapped L-PBF powder was easily removed from the deep channels. Conversely, trapped EBSM powder was difficult to remove using ultrasonic polishing as the powder was sintered inside the channels. It was shown that the powder recovered by the ultrasonic polishing process had size distributions, surface chemistry, morphology and porosity similar to the virgin powder. It is suggested, on these bases, that the recovered powder could likely be recycled without detrimental effects on the process operation.

However, the high cost of preclinical studies creates a gap between investigation and the device market for the biomedical industry. In this work, bone-tailored scaffolds based on the Ti6Al4V alloy manufactured by electron beam melting (EBM) technology with reused powder were investigated, aiming to overcome issues connected to the high cost of preclinical studies. Two different elementary unit cell scaffold geometries, namely diamond (DO) and rhombic dodecahedron (RD), were adopted, while surface functionalization was performed by coating scaffolds with single layers of polycaprolactone (PCL) or with mixture of polycaprolactone and 20 wt.% hydroxyapatite (PCL/HA). The mechanical and biological performances of the produced scaffolds were investigated, and the results were compared to software simulation and experimental evidence available in literature. Good mechanical properties and a favorable environment for cell growth were obtained for all combinations of scaffold geometry and surface functionalization. In conclusion, powder recycling provides a viable practice for the biomedical industry to strongly reduce preclinical costs without altering biomechanical performance.

J	Chung, LLP; Wong, YC; Arulrajah, A				Chung, Leopold Lee Poh; Wong, Yat Choy; Arulrajah, Arul			The Application of Spent Coffee Grounds and Tea Wastes as Additives in Alkali-Activated Bricks	WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION			English	Article						Spent coffee grounds; Tea waste; Recycling; Unfired brick; Alkali-activation	SOLIDS-TO-LIQUID; FLY-ASH; SLAG; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR; RATIOS; COB	The traditional firing process to manufacture building bricks is not sustainable because of the high firing temperature and greenhouse gas emission. Therefore, there is a growing incentive to invest in green technologies with minimal environmental impacts. This study ascertained the potential use of Spent Coffee Grounds (SCG) and Tea Waste (TW) as additives to manufacture unfired clay bricks through alkali-activation. The ambition of this study is to divert SCG and TW from landfills and promote sustainable construction practice. An alkali-activated binder was used in this study by activating mill clay residues (precursor) with a liquid mixture of NaOH and Na2SiO3 solutions at a fixed(-)Na(2)SiO(3)/NaOH ratio of 0.7. Small amounts (1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 wt%) of SCG and TW were added to the binder and mechanically blended for 2.5 min. Block samples were moulded by compressing the slurry in a steel mould. Once demoulded, the block samples were dried in an oven temperature at 110 degrees C for 24 h, then cured at ambient temperature. Fabricated samples were subjected to unconfined compressive strength test, moisture absorption test and tested samples were also characterised by Optical and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). SEM micrographs showed the discovery of active fungi in the samples containing high SCG content (5 wt% and above) but not in the samples made with TW. The results showed that the samples with up to 2.5 wt% SCG and 10 wt% TW met the minimum compressive strength requirement (8.6 MPa) for structural applications with satisfactory moisture absorption values, as per ASTM C62.

The study was conducted on three types of stainless steel 316L powders in categories of virgin, recycled, and a blended mixture of the former two. Three independent laboratories participated in this study and the results were compared for repeat-ability and reproducibility. The outcome of the present work revealed the capability of the GranuDrum (R) to differentiate between the powders and show its sensitivity to changes in powder morphology and characteristics. The methodology also allowed determination of the critical speeds at which the powder flow regime changes between: rolling, cascading, and cataracting modes with an increase in rotation speed, and how these transitions are affected by the powder characteristics. Finally, the study shows the relevance of the cohesive index measurement as a function of the rotating speed in the framework of additive manufacturing.

This work describes the changes in the behavior of the clay material used in a red-clay industry due to additions of a granite and marble sludge, produced in an ornamental stone processing industry in Rio Grande do Norte-Brazil. Mixtures of clay and waste material (10-50 wt.%) were uniaxially pressed and sintered at temperatures ranging from 950 to 1150 degrees C. Results from chemical and mineralogical analysis (XRD and XRF), thermal analysis (DTA, TG and dilatometry), apparent density, water absorption and flexural strength, show that the granite and marble sludge can be added to the clay material with no detrimental effect on the properties of the sintered red-clay products. The reject acts as a flux agent, reducing the sintering temperature of the clay material. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements characterize the material by recording their phase and mass changes as a function of temperature. The DSC results confirmed the decrease of crystallinity with the inclusion of nano fillers but also realized that these filler particles act as a thermodynamic sink and improves its stability. The TGA analysis also demonstrated the increase in thermal stability and flame retardancy level of NC material.

The waste plastic toys can pose a great risk to both people and the environment; at the same time, we will lose many valuable materials that could be recycled. The aim of the present study was to explore the possibility of producing high quality products from waste plastic toys whilst enabling waste plastics to retain their original colour profile. First, the recyclability of the waste plastic toys was investigated using a single screw extruder. The physical, chemical and mechanical properties of prepared filaments were evaluated. Repeated thermo-mechanical stresses did not alter the properties of polymers significantly until ten reprocessing cycles, which suggests that waste plastic toys can be recycled at the end of their lives. Then, the filaments produced from both waste plastic toys and virgin polymer served to fabricate products using a three-dimensional (3D) printer, to examine the possibility of producing high quality products using new manufacturing techniques. The tensile strength, elastic modulus and impact strength of the printed product were found to be 32 +/- 2 MPa, 2253 +/- 271 MPa and 40 +/- 1 kJ/m(2), respectively. The mechanical properties of the 3D printed specimens from waste plastics were as good as virgin material. The process developed in this study can reduce carbon footprint and production cost. The utilisation of waste plastic toys as feedstock to produce new plastic products is not only an environment-friendly option but also profitable.

Microstructure and primary cellular arm spacing (PCAS) are studied analysing the relationship with the cooling rate at the different heights of DED processed 316L stainless steel sample. It is found that, by increasing the deposition distance from the substrate, the PCAS of the sample increases from 2.9 to 4.5 mu m, as a consequence of the decreased cooling rate and thermal gradient. On the other hand, in the last deposited layers, the PCAS of the sample decreases from 4.5 to 3.3 mu m, because of the changes in cooling mechanisms. The phase composition of samples after deposition is revealed and compared with the predictions based on the Schaeffler and Pseudo-binary diagrams. It is revealed that the final microstructure is characterized by austenitic dendrites together with some residual delta ferrite located at dendritic arms location. Lastly, the effect of using fresh or recycled powders, on the microstructure and mechanical properties of DED 316L stainless steel parts is investigated. It is found that the samples fabricated using recycled powders have rather similar tensile strength levels, but much lower elongation than those produced using fresh powder due to a lower inclusions content and of their average lower size. The nature of these inclusions is discussed as well as the reason for their increase both in numbers and size.

Recent developments in sustainably sourced protein-based biomaterials	BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS			English	Review							WHEY-PROTEIN; SILK FIBROIN; NANO-NETS; IN-VITRO; COLLAGEN; HYDROGEL; KERATIN; FABRICATION; FIBRILS; DRUG	Research into the development of sustainable biomaterials is increasing in both interest and global importance due to the increasing demand for materials with decreased environmental impact. This research field utilises natural, renewable resources to develop innovative biomaterials. The development of sustainable biomaterials encompasses the entire material life cycle, from desirable traits, and environmental impact from production through to recycling or disposal. The main objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive definition of sustainable biomaterials and to give an overview of the use of natural proteins in biomaterial development. Proteins such as collagen, gelatin, keratin, and silk, are biocompatible, biodegradable, and may form materials with varying properties. Proteins, therefore, provide an intriguing source of biomaterials for numerous applications, including additive manufacturing, nanotechnology, and tissue engineering. We give an insight into current research and future directions in each of these areas, to expand knowledge on the capabilities of sustainably sourced proteins as advanced biomaterials.

In terms of methodological assumptions, the authors highlighted the mix design components and production procedure for CMA. Acceleration of strength in CMA is related chiefly to mixture curing over time, influenced by different curing regimes to simulated field curing conditions, as highlighted in this study. The additional factor that influences the mechanical strength of CMA is deeply reviewed, which helps the engineers and researchers to improve the existing CMA used in road sectors. The examples of the contents mapped in the review of strength enhancement of CMA are mixture and binder modifiers, fillers and fibers and some other recycling materials and rehabilitation techniques that may influence the sustainability of CMA. The reviewed publications expose scenarios under which different adopted materials and methods can reduce the major distress phenomenon such as fatigue and rutting of CMA. To promote the application of CMA, this manuscript reviewed a deep insight view about the technical aspects associated with CMA.

In this work, the feasibility of WPCBP as curing accelerator and reinforcing filler in styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) composites was first explored. Vulcanization parameters and kinetics of SBR compounds were systematically investigated by moving-die rheometer and differential scanning calorimeter. The results suggested that the incorporation of WPCBP can effectively reduce vulcanization activation energy and shorten the manufacturing cycle of SBR/SiO2 composites, which may be attributed to the activation effect from metal oxide and accelerating effect from residual additives in WPCBP. On the other hand, the coupling interfacial interactions of rubber-SiO2 and rubber-WPCBP result in simultaneous enhancements of tensile strength, tensile modulus, and extensibility of SBR/SiO2/WPCBP composites. Moreover, the potential applications and challenges of SBR/SiO2/WPCBP composites were also briefly analyzed. This work offers a green and efficient reutilization approach of WPCBP in elastomer composites, which may be a valuable inspiration for the high-valued utilization of WPCBP and the preparation of high-performance and low-cost elastomer composites.

J	Yan, SQ; Sagoe-Crentsil, K; Shapiro, G				Yan, Shiqin; Sagoe-Crentsil, Kwesi; Shapiro, Gretta			Reuse of de-inking sludge from wastepaper recycling in cement mortar products	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						De-inking sludge; Cement mortar; Compressive strength; Drying shrinkage; Environmental management		This paper presents results of an investigation into the use of de-inking sludge from a paper recycling mill as feedstock material in the manufacture of cement mortar products, including masonry blocks and mortar renders. Both physical and mechanical properties of mortar specimens containing various amounts of de-inking sludge were investigated. It was observed that the addition of de-inking sludge to cement mortar at a fixed water-to-cement ratio significantly reduced flow properties and increased setting time. Water absorption and volume of permeable voids of cement mortar increased with increased dosage of de-inking sludge, with a corresponding reduction of bulk density. The 91-day compressive strength of mortar samples with 2.5 wt% and 20 wt% de-inking sludge loadings retained 83% and 62% respectively of the reference mortar strength. The corresponding drying shrinkage increased by up to 160% compared to reference samples. However, a de-inking sludge loading of up to 2.5 wt% did not significantly alter measured physical and mechanical properties. The results demonstrate that despite the high moisture absorbance of de-inking sludge due to its organic matter and residual cellulose fibre content, it serves as a potential supplementary additive and its cellulosic content proving to be an active set retardant to cementitious masonry products.

As well as microplastics, chemical additives added to plastics during manufacture which may leach out upon ingestion, will enter food chains and potentially cause humans serious health problems. Regulations in many counties/regions have been setup or to be implemented to ban the production/sale and use of primary microplastics (e.g., microbeads), which could reduce microplastics in the aquatic environment in certain level. However, the fragments from larger plastic items (second microplastics) are major contributors, and then new legislations have to be proposed and implemented in order to substantially reduce the amounts of microplastics in the environment and the associated environmental impact. Moreover, approaches and measures are to be taken by encouraging companies and all users to adopt the Reduce-Reuse-Recycle circular economy as this will represent a cost-effective way of reducing the quantity of plastic objects and microplastics particles entering and gathering in the marine/aquatic environment.

In the LP3DCP process, the integration of large particles, i.e., naturally coarse, crushed or recycled aggregates, reduces the cement volume fraction by more than 50% compared to structures conventionally printed with mortar. Hence, with LP3DCP, the global warming potential, the acidification potential and the total non-renewable primary energy of 3D printed structures can be reduced by approximately 30%. Additionally, the increased proportion of aggregates enables higher compressive strengths than without the coarse aggregates, ranging up to 65 MPa. This article presents fundamental material investigations on particle packing and matrix penetration as well as compressive strength tests and geometry studies. The results of this systematic investigation are presented, and the best set is applied to produce a large-scale demonstrator of one cubic meter of size and complex geometry. Moreover, the demonstrator features reinforcement and subtractive surface processing strategies. Further improvements of the LP3DCP technology as well as construction applications and architectural design potentials are discussed thereafter.

A small proportion of C&D wastes contain substances which make them hazardous, for example, those wastes containing asbestos, mineral fibres, additives, some paints and resins, among others. On the other hand, in the manufacturing of several products used in the construction industry many hazardous substances are utilized. In most cases these materials are relatively safe while being used, but they become dangerous when they are broken, spilled or released in some way. There are other wastes groups which are not hazardous by themselves, but they can suffer reactions, producing toxic substances. These groups include, for example, some plastics or treated woods, which can emit toxic gases when they are burnt for energetic profit. In this work a scheme is presented for the safe management of construction and demolition wastes containing hazardous substances, starting from an inventory of hazardous wastes. This scheme takes into account different stages: i) selective extraction avoiding the mixture with no hazardous wastes, ii) characterization of hazardous substances contained in C&D, iii) feasibility evaluation of the reuse or recycle of the analyzed material and, iv) adequate treatment either for recycling or for safe final disposal. This constitutes the first step in the way of obtaining proper norms in this area, absent nowadays from the local regulations.

J	Lu, C; Xiao, MZ; Qu, YB; Yin, Y; Zhang, RH				Lu Chao; Xiao Mengzhi; Qu Yuebo; Yin Yan; Zhang Ruihua			Evolution Mechanism of Powder Properties of Recycled 316L Stainless Steel in Selective Laser Melting	CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG			Chinese	Article						laser technique; selective laser melting; recycling; oxidation spot; powder properties; evolution mechanism	BED FUSION; MICROSTRUCTURE; DENUDATION; FLOW; FEEDSTOCK; DYNAMICS; SPATTER; IMPACT; FLUID	Objective The interaction between laser and powder particles has a significant influence on the characteristics of the powders during the selective laser melting (SLM) process. However, the understanding of the transformation and evolution mechanism of the recycled powder in SLM is limited. The physical and chemical properties of powder change significantly with the increase in powder recycling times in the SLM process. Nevertheless, research on the variation of powder properties with the increase in recycling times is inadequate. Some researchers have studied the recycling of 316L stainless steel (SS), Ti6AI4V, AlSi10Mg, and CoCr alloy powders, but no consistent regulation has been obtained owing to the differences in recycling methods, forming equipment, forming processes, and the number of uses. The 316L SS powder is a widely used material owing to excellent corrosion resistance and good weldability. Therefore, studying the variation regulation of 316L SS powder characteristics with the increase in SLM recycling times is necessary to understand the variation and oxidation mechanism of the recycled powder, which helps to elucidate the reason for the unstable quality of SLM parts. The findings of this study can help understand the evolution of powder characteristics during the 316L SS powder recycling process better, judge recycling characteristics, and develop recycling standards. The study method is also applicable to other powder bed melting additive manufacturing technologies. Methods The raw material selected was 20 kg 316L SS powder. In the early SLM experiment and small-batch processing, argon (Ar) with a purity of 99. 99 % was continuously filled to keep the oxygen ( 02) content in the forming chamber below 5 x 10(-4) ( volume fraction) to prevent material oxidation during the forming process. After each test or production, the SS powder was strictly screened and then dried to remove water vapor. Some dried SS powder was taken as the sample for detection and analysis, and the physical and chemical characteristics were analyzed. The characteristics of the SS powder, such as particle size distribution, bulk density, tap density, fluidity, morphology, composition, 02 content, and surface microstructure, were comprehensively studied. No new powder was added to the sample powder during recycling. The particle size, physical properties, surface morphology, microstructure, and element content of SLM recycled powder were analyzed using a laser particle size analyzer, physical property tester, scanning electron microscope, and energy dispersive spectrometer. Results and Discussions The proportion of fine and coarse SS powders, respectively, decreases and increases with increase in SLM recycling times, indicating that the particle size distribution of the SLM recycled powder was coarser and more concentrated. Owing to the formation of irregular coarse particles inducing more voids and bridging between the stacked powders, the bulk and tap densities of the recycled powders showed decreasing trends, and fluidity improved. The recycled powder had more irregular, sintered, broken, rod-shaped, and spherical particles than the virgin powder, which is owing to laser-powder-molten pool interaction. Large size powder particles with black circular spots on the surface were found in the powder that was recycled many times. EDS analysis showed that the circular oxidation spots were rich in silicon (Si) and manganese (Mn). The formation of circular spots on the surface of large particles was closely related to 0 affinity, high-temperature diffusion rate, and 02 partial pressure. The surface microstructure of the powder gradually changed from coarse dendrites to cellular crystals owing to the thermal radiation of the laser. In this study, the irregular particles in the recycled powders were divided into two categories: laser-induced melt ejection particles and gas entrainment-induced irregular particles. The different formation mechanisms of these two types of irregular particles were discussed in detail, respectively. The weak magnetic particles of 316L austenitic SS powders produced by phase transformation in SLM were also revealed. Conclusions The D-90 and D-10 of 316L SS powder increased by 14.5 % and 26.5 Yo, respectively, after 30 recycling times in SLM. The particle size distribution of the powder coarsens with the increase in recycling times, with more rod -shaped, broken, and irregular particles in the recycled powder. The oxidation spots formed on the surface of spherical particles with larger diameters were rich in Si and Mn. The formation mechanism of oxidation spots was mainly determined by element type, 0 affinity, high-temperature diffusion rate, and oxidation potential. Dendrite content in the surface microstructure of the recycled powders significantly reduced. The irregular particles in the recycled powders were divided into two categories: laser-induced melt ejection particles and gas entrainmentinduced irregular particles. The formation mechanisms of the two irregular particle categories were related to the molten pool instability and Ar vortex, respectively. The recycled powders also exhibited weak magnetism owing to recrystallization.

Plastic packaging is diverse and made of multiple polymers and numerous additives, along with other components, such as adhesives or coatings. Further, packaging can contain residues from substances used during manufacturing, such as solvents, along with non-intentionally added substances (NIAS), such as impurities, oligomers, or degradation products. To characterize risks from chemicals potentially released during manufacturing, use, disposal, and/or recycling of packaging, comprehensive information on all chemicals involved is needed. Here, we present a database of Chemicals associated with Plastic Packaging (CPPdb), which includes chemicals used during manufacturing and/or present in final packaging articles. The CPPdb lists 906 chemicals likely associated with plastic packaging and 3377 substances that are possibly associated. Of the 906 chemicals likely associated with plastic packaging, 63 rank highest for human health hazards and 68 for environmental hazards according to the harmonized hazard classifications assigned by the European Chemicals Agency within the Classification, Labeling and Packaging (CLP) regulation implementing the United Nations' Globally Harmonized System (GHS). Further, 7 of the 906 substances are classified in the European Union as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT), or very persistent, very bioaccumulative (vPvB), and 15 as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). Thirty-four of the 906 chemicals are also recognized as EDC or potential EDC in the recent EDC report by the United Nations Environment Programme. The identified hazardous chemicals are used in plastics as monomers, intermediates, solvents, surfactants, plasticizers, stabilizers, biocides, flame retardants, accelerators, and colorants, among other functions. Ourwork was challenged by a lack of transparency and incompleteness of publicly available information on both the use and toxicity of numerous substances. The most hazardous chemicals identified here should be assessed in detail as potential candidates for substitution. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Examples of this include protection against wear, erosion, abrasion, and heat. In a specific sense, thermal spraying is particularly used to deposit thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) which finds use in transportation, power generation and automotive sector. As being a surface technique, thermal spraying much like other surface coating techniques can avoid the use of excessive bulk materials and in turn offers longevity to the life of the component, so it already contributes to the reduction of global warming by virtue of avoiding the use of excessive scarce materials and improving fuel efficiency. In terms of its contribution to the cause of global warming, thermal spraying stands in sharp contrast to the energy-intensive processes such as melting, casting, extrusion and welding. With the rise of additive manufacturing, it is possible to use thermal spray to complement that process in many ways and "cold spray additive manufacturing" (CSAM) is already gaining popularity. The thermal spraying technique relies on using selective types of gases-hydrogen being one of them and few types of metals/alloys which are now classed as critical raw materials due to them being on the supply risk register. Efforts to consider recycling and reuse and to find alternatives to these are very timely to continue drawing the advantage of thermal spraying being a relatively green technique. In particular, the green energy initiatives and the drive to develop energy storage and battery technologies could challenge the supply of raw materials such as hydrogen gas and rare earth elements. This underlines the research and development need for alternate materials and processes to address the issue of climate change which is the major focal point of the COP 26 Summit at Glasgow in 2021. The combination of digital technologies and thermal spray coatings will reduce gas, powder and power consumption, which will make this manufacturing process even greener.

Nevertheless, the AR suffers from serious problems: it is too viscous to handle and needs special continuous agitating unit to avoid phase segregation. However, a good alternative is wet process Terminal Blend (TB) rubberized binder which is different from AR in terms of manufacturing process, modification mechanism and binder performance. Although been considered as a viable competitor against polymer modified asphalt, TB binder has not received extensive application due to some concerns. The present paper aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on TB recycled tyre rubber modified binder in terms of basic terminology, binder processing, performance evaluation, applications and primary limitations. Most importantly, the latest progresses in TB binders and their limitations were introduced based on up-to-date researches. Special emphases were laid on the composite modification to TB asphalts using various modifiers such as polymers, acids, nano material and natural rock asphalt. In addition, the combination of currently prevailing warm mix additives with TB rubberized binder was also summarized and discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Modification of gypsum binder by adding metallurgical dust in quantity 0.5% from the weight the binder caused the significant change in microstructure of the gypsum stone, this led to an increase in compressive strength by 80% and to increase of softening coefficient up to 0.85. Such parameters are provided due to formation of crystals of the gypsum protected by an environment of amorphous structure, less soluble, than the not protected crystals of gypsum, preventing destruction crystals of gypsum and water limiting access to crystals of gypsum matrix. For achievement synergetic effect with metallurgical dust dispersions multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were added. MWCNTs act as the centers of crystallization on which surface is going the formation of the ordered dense structure to block packing crystals. The presence in metallurgical dust calcium hydroxide leads to formation of amorphous phase on surface of crystals of gypsum. The developed plaster composition modified by the combined additive according to its properties is similar to waterproof materials. Recycling of metallurgical dust using it as the additive modifying gypsum binder, will improve the ecological conditions in area of an arrangement of the steel production metallurgical complexes.

Brick samples without additives were handmade using a clayey earth that is rich in quartz and phyllosilicates and has some carbonate content. Similar bricks were made with added sawdust at 2.5%, 5% and 10% weight. The bricks were fired in an electric kiln at 800 degrees C, 950 degrees C and 1100 degrees C. The addition of sawdust did not change the mineralogy of the fired bricks. As the firing temperature increased, the quartz content fell and carbonates and phyllosilicates disappeared causing new silicates (gehlenite, wollastonite, anorthite and diopside) to develop. There was an increase in the vitrification of bricks, which also became more compact. At high firing temperature, the bricks had a higher water absorption capacity and worse interconnection between the pores. The high level of vitrification reached at 1100 degrees C enabled greater transmission of heat inside the bricks. The most refractory bricks were those fired at 800 degrees C with a 10% sawdust content. When subjected to the salt crystallization test, the most resistant bricks were those with the lowest sawdust content and the highest firing temperature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Some of the problems described by the athletes when using the mouthguards can be addressed by producing customized devices with thinner walls by additive processing techniques. In the present work, new polymeric materials for this application, such as poly(lactic acid) (rPLA) recycled from food packaging, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), high impact polystyrene (HIPS), and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), are proposed for the preparation of protective mouthguards, in alternative to the ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer, the current gold standard. Specimens were printed with two different thicknesses (2 mm and 4 mm) to study their influence on the final properties of the printed samples. The characterization included chemical, thermal, surface, and mechanical aspects of commercially acquired polymeric filaments and printed components. All the studied materials showed a decrease in the impact strength with increasing specimen thickness, except for TPU due to its highest deformation capacity. Compared with EVA, TPU has a similar energy absorption, while the other polymers presented higher values. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Recycling also helps to reduce land, water, and air pollution as well as waste landfilling issues. The present work has been done to explore the prospect of partial replacement of natural soil for brick manufacturing with municipal waste, which is soda-lime glass. In this study, the effect of waste glass additives on the physical and mechanical properties of brick has been investigated. Bricks were manufactured using 2%, 4%, 10%, 16%, 30%, and 40% of waste glass replacing natural clay. Compressive strength, water absorption, and other tests were carried out to determine the mechanical performance and durability of the prepared brick specimens. An increase in compressive strength and decrease in water absorption of the samples were observed with the addition of waste glass. It was found that the developed bricks have been satisfying the parameters of the Grade-A and Grade-S brick in accordance with the Bangladeshi standard for conventional building clay brick (BDS 208). Results obtained from this study indicated that partial replacement of natural clay in brick with waste soda-lime glass makes the brick production sustainable and eco-friendly.

Design/methodology/approach - Controlling the polymer degradation requires an understanding of many different phenomena, including the different chemical mechanisms underlying structural changes in polymer macromolecules, the influences of polymer morphology, the complexities of oxidation chemistry and the complex reaction pathways of polymer additives. Several ageing characterization experiments are given. Findings - The paper covers the ageing process analysis of acrylate-based polymers. An overview of the ageing behaviour is given, along with the bandwidth of material characteristics for a prolonged lifetime of this material class. Research limitations/implications - For research and development in the field of rapid prototyping (RP) materials data about ageing behaviour and environmental effects are crucial. The authors show possible methods for measuring these effects and discuss the consequences in material research using a recently developed biocompatible SL resin as an example. Practical implications - The study of the ageing behaviour of polymers is important for understanding their usability, storage, lifetime and recycling. The presented polymeric formulations are able to meet the growing demand for both soft and stiff manufacturing resin materials in the engineering and medical fields. Originality/value - The analysis of the ageing behaviour of polymer materials is an important issue for engineering applications, recycling of post-consumer plastic waste, as well as the use of polymers as biological implants and matrices for drug delivery and the lifetime of an article.

Preparation and characterization of olive pit powder as a filler to PLA-matrix bio-composites	POWDER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Olive pit powder; PIA; Grinding; Size distribution; Morphology; Mechanical properties	LIGNOCELLULOSIC WASTE FLOUR; STONE	This study is focused on recycling potential of some waste materials, such as olive pits, i.e. the solid phase derived from an olive oil mill, blended with thermoplastic polymers and used for the production of new materials applied in manufacturing containers and formworks. The olive pit powders are described and characterized. Then the powder is introduced in a bio-based and biodegradable matrix (polylactic acid, PIA) at various percentages. In this study, a comparison of the size distribution and the densities of olive pit powders according to the grinding methods ( planetary mill and centrifugal mill) was made. The analyses showed that olive pits can be further studied as additive for the production of green materials. The development of an agricultural based polymer matrix compatible with olive pits and consequently a fully biodegradable composite system is the future and ultimate goal of the research undertaken. For that purpose, composite samples made out of PLA matrix, reinforced with olive pit powders were manufactured and mechanically characterized. With filler loading, an increase in the tensile modulus but a decrease of the flexural strength may be due to the poor interfacial bonding between olive pit powder and PIA (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Alloy 718 powder feedstocks for selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacturing are produced commercially by both gas and rotary atomization and are available typically in the 10-45 or 15-45 mu m size ranges. A comprehensive investigation was conducted to understand the impact of powder variability on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of SLM 718 heat treated to Aerospace Material Specification (AMS) 5664. This study included sixteen virgin powders and three once-recycled powders within the 10-45 and 15-45 mu m size ranges that were obtained from seven direct source suppliers and one reseller. Although alike as highly regular spheroids, these powders showed distinct differences in composition (especially Al, C and N contents), particle size distributions, and powder features such as degree of agglomeration, fusion and surface roughness. Compositional differences expectedly had the strongest impact on microstructure. High N and C contents formed TiN-nitrides and/or (Ti, Nb, Mo)-C carbides on the grain boundaries, prevented recrystallization during heat treatment, and resulted in retained (001)-scalloped shaped grains that ranged from 19 to 41 mu m in average size. In the absence of this particle pinning, the average grain size of the heat treated SLM 718 ranged from 51 to 90 mu m. Room temperature tensile and high cycle fatigue (HCF) testing compared as-fabricated (AF) and low stress ground (LSG) surface conditions. Tensile testing revealed consistent behavior between the two surface conditions and amongst the powder lots. The finer grained SLM 718 builds displayed the lowest tensile properties. A SLM 718 build fabricated from a powder with eight times lower C content showed statistically better tensile properties presumably due to enhanced coarsening of delta-Ni3Nb precipitates. The specimens from once-recycled powders had slightly higher tensile strengths and slightly higher ductility compared to their virgin equivalents; once-recycling also did not substantially degrade the mean HCF life. The LSG fatigue lives agreed with conventionally manufactured 718 data, while AF lives exhibited a knock-down due to surface roughness. The fatigue lives of AF specimens were statistically equivalent across powder lots except for one and failures typically initiated at stress concentrators associated with SLM surface asperities. Fatigue testing of low stress ground specimens result in both transgranular and within facet crack initiations. More than half of the cracks initiated from these facets for the machined condition; however, these facets appeared to be within grains that were larger-than-average in size. A nitrogen-atomized powder with fine prior particles of TiN-nitrides and M(Ti, Nb, Mo) C carbides from atomization on powder surfaces resulted in the best fatigue performance with segregation of these particles to the SLM 718 grain boundaries leading to higher resistance to early-stage crack propagation. Typically the fine-grained builds with minor phases along the grain boundaries did not perform well in fatigue, whereas a larger-grain build with lower carbon content and coarser delta-Ni3Nb precipitates showed the next best HCF response. Further details of the build microstructure and its impact on tensile and fatigue behavior was considered.

Although European policy, through directives given, supports their use and coherent research results derive from the scientific society, their use in practice is limited. It is generally accepted that the use of alternative construction materials with low environmental impact and of low cost is an important issue. As a part of the integration in sustainable development approach, the eco-friendly materials present a great interest in building construction manufacturing. Towards this direction, many studies have been focused on the exploitation of natural fibers as reinforcements in building materials. This study is an attempt to add more experimental results by the use of bio-fibers to building materials in order to ensure the performance of recycled materials such as bio-fibers in the construction sector. Three types of natural fibers jute, coconut and kelp were used as additives in 1.5% by mortar volume. Their role in cement and lime mortars was recorded by testing mechanical, physical and microstructure properties. The results indicate that natural fibers act in favor of strength and durability. Nevertheless, bio-fibers work differently in strong cement mortars in relation to the "soft" lime-based materials. Advantages can be gained in both cases but certain aspects should be taken into account such as the adhesion to the mortar matrix and the water content of the mixture.

It contains several chemicals that are oil, surface active agent, extreme pressure additive, antirust agent, antifoaming agent, preservative, biocide etc.. It is thought that it is not good for environment and human body. Machining fluid mist and splash contained several chemicals that are cause of danger for worker's health while machining Furthermore, time elapses, fluid is rotten by bacteria. Bad smell and degradation of machining performance occurs. Therefore, after using machining fluid, waste fluid is disposed. Incineration or coagulative precipitation and landfill etc. are necessary. It arise great disposal cost and environmental load as discharging of huge amount green house gas (CO2 etc). Then, machining fluid decreasing or non-using is demanded in industry. So, in this investigation, new environmental machining method: the electric rust preventive machining method system that uses only water as machining fluid has been developed In this paper water purification recycle system in water machining system development is mentioned Therefore, complete removal of bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes) without using chemicals such as biocide is examined for corruption, malodor prevention and safe machining water.

Moreover, little efforts are involved in some parts of the world associated to plastic waste collection, recycling and reuse. Considering all these prerequisites, the identification and discussion of risks generated by plastic production and waste in the environment are performed in this paper and some measures for plastic waste reduction were proposed. Although plastic polymers are not considered toxic, some residual monomers contained in the materials can be hazardous. Also, many chemical compounds used in the plastics manufacturing as additives, in particular plasticizers are dangerous to human health and the environment, along with some degradation products that may be released during the plastic life cycle. Bearing in mind the potential impacts and risks generated by these products in the environment and for humans, the paper highlights that the current requirements and tendencies are to reduce the need for plastic, the enhancement of recycling and recovering the waste, simultaneously with the replacement of plastic from fossil fuel with a continuous widening spectrum of biodegradable polymers. Bioplastics began to be recognized as a positive and important invention of chemical and plastics industry, providing many and varied opportunities for environmental impacts and risks abatement.

Four states of IN718 powder (virgin, used, overflow and spatter) were characterized in terms of their morphology, flowability and physico-chemical properties. Studies showed that used and overflow powders were almost identical. The fine particle-size distribution of the virgin powder, in which 50% of particles were found to be below the nominal particle-size distribution (PSD), was recognized as the main reason for its lower flowability and the main cause of the differentiation between virgin, used and overflow powders. Only spatter powder was found to be degraded enough to preclude its direct LPBF reuse. The oxygen content in the spatter powder exceeded the limit value for IN718 by 290 ppm, and aluminum oxide spots were found on the spatter particles surfaces. Laser absorption analysis showed 10 pp higher laser absorption compared to the other powders. The results of evaluation showed that IN718 powder is resistant to multiple uses in the LPBF process. Due to the low degradation rate of IN718 powder, overflow powder can be re-enabled for multiple uses with a proper recycling strategy.

Thermodynamic analyses and experimental results show that Ca3WO6 could be formed by reactions of CaWO4/Fe(Mn)WO4 with CaO, Ca(OH)(2) or CaCO3 in air. Increasing roasting temperature not only accelerates the conversion of CaWO4 to Ca3WO6 but also eliminates the dependence of the conversion on calcium compound types. Moreover, additive CaF2 can greatly reduce roasting temperature for complete conversion of tungsten-containing minerals in mixed concentrate of scheelite and wolframite to Ca3WO6. Additionally, Ca3WO6 clinker prepared by mixed concentrate has good leachability in aqueous ammonium carbonate solution with WO3 recovery of 98.4%. The work presented is favorable for developing a promising technique with recycling both auxiliary materials and solutions for cleaner production of ammonium paratungstate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To find viable solutions and reduce such alarming issues, innovative research work on recycling of unutilized materials such as fly ash and natural cellulosic polymers has been reported in this work to develop advanced sustainable hybrid micro/nano composites. In this study, the use of natural cellulosic sisal fibers with fly ash has enhanced the tensile properties and surface finish of composites. Fly ash particulates acted as fillers, additives, as well as surface-finishing medium and sisal fibers as reinforcing elements in achieving glossy finish sustainable composites. The developed composites have been found to be stronger than wood, plastics and have many opportunities for multifunctional applications. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Design and properties of plaster mortars manufactured with ladle furnace slag	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						Plaster; Ladle furnace slag; Mechanical properties; Porosimetry; Microstructure	MASONRY MORTARS; GYPSUM; DURABILITY; ADDITIVES; CONCRETE; WASTE	This study deals with the properties of a series of plasters containing different proportions of ladle furnace slag used as mineral aggregate. The tests characterise the influences of two admixtures: a super-fluidifier to reduce the water absorption (SikaMix (R)) of mortar plaster and an adhesive emulsion to improve the surface adherence (SikaLatex (R)). The physical and mechanical results confirm the feasibility of employing ladle furnace slag as a mineral aggregate, which induces an increase in density, in vapour permeability and in porosity. The results highlight also a decrease of adherence, durability and mechanical strength, proportionally to the amount of plaster substituted by slag. Scanning electron microscopy imaging and elemental mapping show good interaction between the various constituents. The thermal degradation of the mixtures reflects an improvement in strength resistance in relation to temperature, as further slag is incorporated. The economical study suggests that these recycled materials are cost-effectively viable and may be applied as plaster mortars for use in masonry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Williams, RJ; Fox, L; Majewski, C				Williams, Rhys J.; Fox, Luke; Majewski, Candice			The effect of powder age in high speed sintering of poly(propylene)	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Advanced manufacturing technologies; Additive manufacturing; High speed sintering; Poly(propylene); Powder ageing	BEHAVIOR; POLYPROPYLENE	Purpose This study aims to demonstrate for the first time that the cheap, commodity polymer, poly(propylene), can be successfully processed using high speed sintering, and that it can be recycled several times through the process, with little to no detriment to either the polymer itself or the parts obtained. This is significant as a step towards the realisation of high speed sintering as a technology for high-volume manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach A poly(propylene) powder designed for laser sintering was used to build parts on a high speed sintering machine. The unsintered powder was then collected and reused. Repeating this process allowed creation of seven generations of aged powder. A variety of characterisation techniques were then used to measure polymer, powder and part properties for each generation to discern any effects arising from ageing in the machine. Findings It was found that poly(propylene) could be used successfully in high speed sintering, albeit with a low build success rate. Increased powder age was found to correlate to an increase in the build success rate, changes in microscopic and bulk powder properties and improvement to the dimensional accuracy of the parts obtained. By contrast, no discernible correlations were seen between powder age and polymer molecular weight, or between powder age and the tensile properties of parts. Originality/value This is the first report of the use of poly(propylene) in high speed sintering. It is also first study regarding powder recyclability in high speed sintering, both in general and using poly(propylene) specifically.

A simple route toward next-gen green energy storage concept by nanofibres-based self-supporting electrodes and a solid polymeric design	CARBON			English	Article							LI-ION BATTERIES; PAPER; CELLULOSE; ELECTROLYTES; CATALYSTS; BEHAVIOR; CELLS	A novel, unique, truly-solid Li-ion cell structural design, based on LiFePO4/graphite electrodes and profoundly ionic conducting polymer electrolyte, is fabricated by exploiting, for the first time, carbonised cellulose nanofibrils as both the conductive binder and the current collector substrate. Moreover, cellulose nanofibrils are used as reinforcing additive for the preparation of the unconventional composite polymer electrolyte separator. The resulting solid polymeric lab-scale Li-ion cell, assembled in a "pouch cell" envelop, shows remarkably stable characteristics upon prolonged cycling at ambient temperature even at high current regimes. By the way, a simple procedure, easily scalable, is optimized for the spray coating and water-based papermaking. As a result, all components can be fully recovered at the end of the cell operational life by taking advantage of a simple water-based paper recycling technique, opening new horizons for the manufacture of sustainable electrochemical energy storage devices.

These are: firstly multifunction can be embedded at a material level such as the use of nanomaterials within a polymer. In the second instance, discrete material systems can be added together. Examples are laminate systems in food pouches consisting of thin layers of metal and polymer. In the third process this can be achieved by integrating these materials systems together to form one holistically behaving component with multifunctionality. An example is an embedded antenna in an automotive windscreen.Drivers for multifunctionality include the increased push towards intelligent objects, such as the creation of the internet of things. Here, the embedding of communication and electronic function into daily consumer objects, such as milk cartons and food packaging are demanded. This must be offset by consideration of the related rise of a new wave of short-lifetime waste electronic and electronic equipment, incapable with current plastic recycling infrastructure, for disposal systems to adapt too. Designing integrated and multifunctional plastic components however, is complicated by the sheer number of material choices, multiple processing platforms, cost implications and environmental legislation. Considering just the processes of injection moulding, compression moulding and additive manufacturing, a designer is confronted with considerable complexity and numerous engineering design and stakeholder issues to consider. This paper presents examples of current state of art in multifunctional systems and discusses the barriers and potential solutions to creating fully realized multifunctional systems within a polymeric manufacturing environment. Impacts on material lifecycles and disposal infrastructures must be considered, as is the necessity to retain diversity with new integrated and advanced manufacturing processes suitable for the demands of mass customization, automation and Industry 4.0.

Hence a general and broad overview is presented, rather than recent research results. Driving forces in PD are: Technology, Market and Society. Ecological, economic and social sustainability require recycling, reuse, energy conservation and new business concepts. Customization is carried out by modular architecture, combining customer specific products with volume production of components and sub-systems. PD integrates "hard" properties (engineering), with "soft" properties (industrial design). Fundamental PD characteristics are: Iteration, Integration (technical and organizational), and Innovation. Globally distributed industrial partners co-operate using Internet. Iteration: process loops are speeded up by modeling/simulation, virtual prototyping and additive manufacturing. Structured PD: Initial specification of "what" - functional requirements, then "how" - generation of design solutions. Interdependencies analysis is important to simplify the product's structure. The V-model for specification and verification is commonly used. A 3-stage industrial process separates strategy, core technology development, and product design for market introduction.

They made of polymer binders (thermosets) such as epoxy, silicone and polyurethane incorporated with metallic or conductive fillers, such as silver, copper, nickel, gold, etc., offered mechanical strength with improved thermal conductivity. Due to their unique properties, such as high specific strength and stiffness with relatively low weight, high corrosion resistance and controllable conductivity, metal filled thermoset composites have been used in various industries including electrical and electronic, medical, aircraft and automotive industry. Unfortunately, filler-matrix adhesion, filler dispersion and high material and manufacturing costs caused the implementation of these materials more challenging. Additives such as coupling agents were introduced to improve the performances of metal filled thermoset composites. This review paper covers the fundamentals of thermoset polymer properties, processing method of metal powder, the preparation and characterization of metal filled thermoset composites from previous studies and the advantages and disadvantages of these materials in various industries.

The technology of creation of decking on the basis of wood-plastic composite, consisting of surface and inner layer is presented in the article. The surface layer of the product is made from wood flour, polypropylene, impact resistance modifier and special additives. The inner layer consists of recycled thermoplastic polymer, filled with waste wood up to 10 mm. The influence of the concentration of the species of wood filler on the water absorption and hardness of the samples as well as a group of combustibility of the product has been studied. Researches on the biological stability of floorings that show high resistance to the damaging action of microorganisms are presented. It was found that this construction material is practically non swells and absorbs little moisture in comparison with the analogues.

Sustainability in e-commerce packaging: A review	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Review						E-commerce; Packaging; Sustainability; Cellulose based-materials; Circular economy; Additive manufacturing and robots	HOME DELIVERY; LAST-MILE; FREIGHT TRANSPORT; SUPPLY CHAINS; ONLINE; NANOCELLULOSE; COMPOSITES; URBAN; FIBER; WOOD	Online purchasing, and hence e-commerce packaging production and use, have grown steadily in recent years, and so has their environmental impact as a result. This paper reviews the evolution of packaging over the last century through a compilation of scientific literature on e-commerce packaging focusing on its environmental side. The primary aims were to identify research gaps in e-commerce packaging and to propose new research lines aimed at reducing its environmental impact. A systematic search of abstracts was conducted to identify articles dealing with sustainability in e-commerce packaging in order to better understand changes in materials and formats, identify problems such as oversizing and allow prospective readers to become acquainted with the latest innovations in materials, sustainability and logistics. Based on existing research, packaging materials and technology evolved rapidly until the 1990s. Later, however, it has become increasingly difficult to further reduce their cost and environmental impact. Also, some packaging products continue to be made from non-renewable materials and thus restrict growth of e-commerce. Further research is needed with a view to producing new packages from renewable sources such as cellulose-containing materials, which are widely available in nature, or from recycled cellulose-based materials such as cartonboard. Improving distribution processes with new, more effective tools could additionally help alleviate the environmental impact of packaging. Similarly, new production processes such as additive manufacturing and 3D printing might help optimize package volume and shape, thereby facilitating more sustainable production through, for example, reduced CO2 emissions. Currently available technology can be useful to rethink the whole e-commerce packaging paradigm, which has changed very little over the past few decades. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The real guarantee for the continuation of life is by recycling all types of industrial waste using a method that combines a high level of efficiency and environmental pollution protection. This will create a sustainable resource that keeps earth's natural resources from depletion. In this study, we introduce a technological procedure for the use of cement waste in manufacturing engineering parts with high efficiency. Rheological analysis for styrene butadiene rubber has been investigated as function percentages additives (10-35 pphr) of cement waste (CW) and carbon black (CB). The rheological properties include torque and thermos-plasticity measured at temperature ranges of 165 degrees C, 175 degrees C and 185 degrees C. The tests showed that the cement waste has the ability and efficiency for improving the rheological properties of styrene butadiene rubber.

Since this molecule presents a high potential for the development of a large variety of products, it is of great importance that this resource is harnessed. We present the results obtained from the use of a simple pH-based precipitation technique from which we obtained glycerol with 50% wt. purity and its assessment as a germination additive in two varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) obtaining a competitive behavior when compared with a commercial organic fertilizer within the germination and first stage of plant development suggesting a new use as an added value product for the biofuels industry.

Characterization of Fibers Obtained from Shredded Tires	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						fibers; polyamide; thermal properties; pyrolisis	DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY; PRODUCTS; DEGRADATION; POLYMERS	The importance of recovering waste materials generated by industrialised societies is mainly due to the environmental impact they have, and one of the principal problem areas is tires. In recent years, an enormous amount of tires have been recycled. Metals contained in them have been recovered and the tire particles have been used in diverse applications. A third material that appears in the recovery process is the fibers, which act as reinforcement. Before addressing the possible reuse of these fibers, it is necessary to characterise and identify them. The diverse techniques of thermal analysis allow these fibers to be identified through melt point analysis, the results of which show the presence of polyamide 6 and 6.6. Moreover, the combination of pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry corroborates the identification made with the techniques previously mentioned and also indicates the presence of certain additives used in the manufacture of tires, such as resorcinol and benzothiazole.

During FFF 3-D printing, thermal degradation of the polymer releases small particles and chemicals, many of which are hazardous to human health. In this study, particle and chemical emissions from 10 different filaments made from virgin (never printed) and recycled polymers were used to print the same object at the polymer manufacturer's recommended nozzle temperature ("normal") and at a temperature higher than recommended ("hot") to simulate the real-world scenarios of a person intentionally or unknowingly printing on a machine with a changed setting. Emissions were evaluated in a college teaching laboratory using standard sampling and analytical methods. From mobility sizer measurements, particle number-based emission rates were 81 times higher; the proportion of ultrafine particles (diameter <100 nm) were 4% higher, and median particle sizes were a factor of 2 smaller for hot-temperature prints compared with normal-temperature prints (all p-values <0.05). There was no difference in emission characteristics between recycled and virgin acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and polylactic acid polymer filaments. Reducing contaminant release from FFF 3-D printers in educational settings can be achieved using the hierarchy of controls: (1) elimination/substitution (e.g., training students on principles of prevention-through-design, limiting the use of higher emitting polymer when possible); (2) engineering controls (e.g., using local exhaust ventilation to directly remove contaminants at the printer or isolating the printer from students); (3) administrative controls such as password protecting printer settings and establishing and enforcing adherence to a standard operating procedure based on a proper risk assessment for the setup and use (e.g., limiting the use of temperatures higher than those specified for the filaments used); and (4) maintenance of printers.

J	Souza, LPD; Mansur, HS				Souza, LPD; Mansur, HS			Production and characterization of ceramic pieces obtained by slip casting using powder wastes	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						slate waste; powder technology; minerals characterization; slip casting	TECHNOLOGY; ADDITIVES	The growing world population in industrialized countries is resulting in an increasing consumption of raw materials and thus in a flood of waste. The recycling of materials and waste treatment techniques have drawn the attention from all different areas including industries, technology centers and universities. In the present work the main objective is to recover wastes from slate rock industry, using powder technology by slip casting process to produce ceramic pieces. The characterization of slate powder according to its mineral composition shows the presence of minerals like quartz, chlinoclore, albite, orthoclase and muscovite, which could be used as raw materials for ceramic products. We also have noted a close dependence on powder and additive concentration with the viscosity of suspension. The sintering study was accomplished through density and porosimetry essay, surface area evaluation among others. X-ray results coupled with thermal analysis have clearly indicated major structural transition at 500 and 900 degreesC. The results obtained after sinterization to 1000 degreesC showed that the sintering strongly influenced the structural transition occurred in slate. The results allow us to conclude that slate wastes can be used in the manufacture of ceramic pieces by slip casting. The optimized properties of pieces to different uses can be achieved by controlling the powder characteristics, the molding process and the sintering conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

FUEL; RENEWABLE ENERGY; LAND-USE; ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; LEVELIZED COST; LEARNING-CURVE; PARTIAL SHADE; SOLAR; POLYMER	There is an intense need to optimize agrivoltaic systems. This article describes the invention of a new testing system: the parametric open source cold-frame agrivoltaic system (POSCAS). POSCAS is an adapted gardening cold-frame used in cold climates as it acts as a small greenhouse for agricultural production. POSCAS is designed to test partially transparent solar photovoltaic (PV) modules targeting the agrivoltaic market. It can both function as a traditional cold frame, but it can also be automated to function as a full-service greenhouse. The integrated PV module roof can be used to power the controls or it can be attached to a microinverter to produce power. POSCAS can be placed in an experimental array for testing agricultural and power production. It can be easily adapted for any type of partially transparent PV module. An array of POSCAS systems allows for the testing of agrivoltaic impacts from the percent transparency of the modules by varying the thickness of a thin film PV material or the density of silicon-based cells, and various forms of optical enhancement, anti-reflection coatings and solar light spectral shifting materials in the back sheet. All agrivoltaic variables can be customized to identify ideal PV designs for a given agricultural crop.

Here, for the first time, a sustainable and smart approach is established for manufacturing LiFePO4/C/FeS composites from spent LiFePO4 powders as novel anode materials for alkaline Ni-Fe secondary battery. The LiFePO4/C/FeS composites are prepared via a facile ball milling method by using spent LiFePO4 and commercial FeS as raw materials. When serving as host anode material for Ni-Fe battery, the LiFePO4/C/FeS (40(wt)%) composite exhibits attractive anodic performance in alkaline solution, with a high specific discharge capacity of similar to 232.9 mAh g(-1) (639.1 mAh g(pe)(-1)) at 0.2C, prominent high-rate capabilities (similar to 150.7 mAh g(-1) (413.5 mAh g(Fe)(-1)) still retains even at a high rate up to 5C) and excellent cyclic stability (with retention of as high as 75.9% of its highest capacity after 300 cycles at 1C). Meaningfully, our study proposes a sustainable and economical approach to produce advanced anodes for alkaline Ni-Fe secondary batteries, simultaneously providing an attractive and facile way to recycle spent LiFePO4 materials in large scale.

Global anthropogenic tellurium cycles for 1940-2010	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Material flow analysis; Thin-film materials; Photovoltaics; CdTe; Recycling; Resource management	MATERIALS AVAILABILITY; MULTILEVEL CYCLE; CADMIUM; PHOTOVOLTAICS; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT	Tellurium is increasingly used in solar photovoltaics in the form of cadmium-telluride (CdTe) thin films. There are concerns regarding whether tellurium availability could be a constraint on large-scale deployment of CdTe photovoltaics. The present work brings a new perspective to the discussion of tellurium availability by providing the first extant global tellurium cycles constructed with material flow analysis principles. The tellurium cycles, for 1940-2010, present information on the production, fabrication and manufacturing, use, and resource management stages during this period. The results of the analysis show that during 1940-2010 approximately 11 Gg of refined tellurium was produced. This represents about 4.5% of the tellurium that was extracted from the ground during copper mining. Almost 80% of the refined tellurium, 8.5 Gg, was dissipated into end-uses such as metallurgical additives to iron, steel, and nonferrous metals, and thereby lost to potential reuse. As of 2010, the in-use tellurium stock is estimated at 1.1 Gg, which mainly accumulated after 1990s with the increasing tellurium use in electronics, specifically photovoltaic and thermoelectric devices. Because tellurium is a byproduct of copper ores, its supply can be enhanced by more attention to recovery during processing of the copper parent.

Sustainable solutions for road pavements: A multi-scale characterization of warm mix asphalts containing steel slags	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						WMA; Surfactant-based chemical additive; EAF steel slags; Stiffness; Fatigue; Rutting	ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; LABORATORY EVALUATION; PERFORMANCE; ADDITIVES; MIXTURES; AGGREGATE; CONCRETE; BINDERS	Research and application concerning the use of environmentally friendly materials and technologies in road pavements have reached high relevance mainly due to the increasing public consciousness addressed to environmental protection and preservation. Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) is a valid option in this regard. In fact, WMA is a cleaner asphalt concrete that can be prepared and compacted at lower temperatures than the traditional Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA). Moreover, the inclusion of recycled waste materials in WMA can further enhance its environmental sustainability. Given this background, the present paper illustrates the overall results of a wide research study aimed at verifying the utilization feasibility of steel slags in warm-modified asphalt concretes. This was accomplished by investigating in the laboratory the midrange and high-service temperature properties of warm bituminous binders, as well as mastics and mixtures containing steel slag aggregates. The warm modification was performed using a chemical tensioactive additive; steel slags were produced in a metallurgical plant by electric arc furnace (EAF) treatment. To evaluate the combined effect of manufactured EAF steel slags and warm chemical additive, a comparative analysis was carried out taking into account unmodified binders as well as mastics and mixtures prepared with only natural aggregates. Binders, mastics and mixtures were studied in terms of stiffness, fatigue and permanent deformation resistance by carrying out dynamic tests on unaged and long-term aged samples. The results showed that cleaner materials prepared combining chemical warm technology and EAF steel slag aggregates seem to assure equal or even enhanced performance than the corresponding traditional hot mixed materials, demonstrating promising field applicability. In particular, the influence of lower mixing and compaction temperatures of the warm mixtures on stiffness, fatigue and rutting behaviour seemed to hide the contribution (positive or negative) due to the presence of EAF steel slag aggregates. In fact, the potential higher stiffness and rutting resistance of steel slag mixtures were limited whereas the possible lower fatigue resistance was positively counterbalanced. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Of course, for these reasons the definitive object prototype has to be just alike the output, be it a tapping screw or a medical prosthesis, or a part of machine, or a component of engine, or a design product. As we know, the processes of original design are prototyping, testing and making. As I have tried to explain in this last seven years to my Industrial Design and Fashion Design Courses students, the product meant to the industrial fabrication, less or more automated, is the result of a series of considerations of complex nature (material and immaterial) and comparisons with contemporary homologous production, that take place during the different phases from the concept to the fabrication up to the retailing. Sometimes it's necessary to rectify technical adjustments and improve possible innovative organizational and management processes. There will be feedback relating to project reviews, method of manufacture, shape modeling, materials, practicality, manufacturing costs analysis, logistics respects, packaging, storage, quality control, up to just in time fabrication. But this is unsatisfactory: one has to bear in mind eco compatibility instances, e.g. recycling programs, issues relative to LCD (Life Cycle Design) product and sometimes those ones concerning ethical, educational and cultural plus value too. Independently of possibility to the use of fabrication machines, we have worked towards examination and cognizance of the shape and function of the prototype, the base of any additive or subtractive method of fabrication, it be handmade or automated, preferably testing recycling methodologies, or de-contextualizing materials such kevlar and carbon fiber. At the first step, the pencil sketches and, if possible, the handmade fabrication are still the best ways to realize an intrinsic contact with the embryonic concept and its initial developments. Otherwise I have remarked that even in the drawing step some students prefer the immediate use of CAD; I have to confess that sometimes the results are even appreciable. It's a new kind of sensitivity, often more standardized, but in any case able to find a synthetic fusion between formal and technological layouts. On the other hand, this is similar to what has happened in writing since the introduction of Microsoft Word, that has surely influenced it displacing creativity from the pen world to the pc keyboards one.

To such waste, we refer dispersed waste of metalworking formed while cutting of metals, operation of crushing machines, etc. The purpose of this work is to study the composition and properties of waste from hydro-abrasion (waterjet) cutting of metals and estimation of their use in the production of building materials. They are related to V class of hazard the conditions of their formation are such that no new compounds arise complicating their possible application. The essence of the process of waterjet cutting, mechanism of waste formation, substance composition and volumes of waste accumulation at the enterprises, current situation in the sphere of their utilization is described. The composition and properties of the abrasive applied - garnet sand composed mainly of ferrous-aluminium garnet - almandite - one of the most hard and durable of known useful minerals. A complex investigation of waste from waterjet cutting was carried out: the average and bulk density, granulometric composition, chemical composition were determined, the electron microscopic study of various waste fractions was performed. It was found that in the process of cutting, the destruction of abrasive particles occurs, the size and shape of granules changes as well as the nature of their surface, a large amount of dust fraction appears, where particles of cut metal fall. At the same time, in the process of sand particles destruction, new abrasive faces arise, and their recycling is possible. It was established that waste of waterjet cutting of metals present very small, practically uniform heavy sands with high content of dust fraction, in the chemical composition of which prevail ferric oxides, silicon and aluminium oxides. Such characteristic of waste allowed mark possible ways of their application: 1) in the production of pottery work as inert additives and flux-additives, 2) in the production of Portland cement as corrective iron-containing additive and component of raw mix for high ferriferous cements; 3) as a filling agent in mortars, including special mortars, 4) as a pigment for voluminous painting of building materials, etc. Positive results have been obtained on the use of waste from waterjet cutting in the production of ceramics. A raw mix consisted by 50% (by mass) of montmorillonite clay and by 50% of waste from waterjet cutting of steel. After burning at 900 degrees C, physical mechanical properties of samples have been determined. The results obtained permitted to make the conclusion about the possibility of using these waste as the poly-functional additive in the manufacture of ceramics.

In this investigation, for the first time, sludge from the inert mineral part of the construction and demolition waste (RA-S) is used as a primary raw material in the fabrication of fired bricks for building purposes. Fired bricks fabricated with different dosages of RA-S and earth material (i.e., 0%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 100% by weight) were prepared and evaluated in terms of their physical-chemical properties. The RA-S was characterized, and the results showed that it could be classified as a clayey material and richly graded silty sand according to the French Standards. XRD analysis revealed that the addition of the RA sludge into raw earth material provoked changes slightly in the fired bricks. The compressive strength (CS) results indicated that the CS of the fired bricks increased with the addition of the RA-S from 30% to 70%. The highest CS was attained at the firing temperature of 800 degrees C. The density of the fired brick slightly reduced with the RA-S addition. The thermal conductivity results suggest that RA-S has better insulation properties compared to earth material. The RA-S sludge can be used in combination with earth material to fabricate fired bricks, which can meet the requirements of many Standards all over the World. In the light of these results, it is possible to say that the RA-S generated from recycling inert mineral part of construction and demolition waste plant is an excellent raw material to prepare efficient fired bricks that can be successfully employed in the real construction sector. Also, the highlighted results suggest that brickwork factories have the opportunity to improve production quality while significantly reducing manufacturing time, energy consumption, resource depletion, and environmental impact.

No 18455 and FCM substance No 01014. According to the applicant, the two substances are used together as a chain extender for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to increase the molecular weight of the polymer after recycling. Final articles are intended for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long-term storage at room temperature, with-or without prior pasteurisation at up to 70 degrees C. Specific migration tests for TEOS and HMDS were not performed. Instead, the residual content of the substances in a recycled PET polymer manufactured with the modifier mixture was determined. The substances were not detected at detection levels up to 4 mu g/6 dm(2), supporting that the substances react completely with the PET chains. In a migration study, a recycled PET modified using the mixture was compared with virgin PET. All detected migrating substances corresponded to oligomers identical to those from the virgin PET, at a detection level estimated to be 3 mu g/kg. Based on the toxicological data provided, the CEF Panel concluded that there is no indication of a genotoxic potential for TEOS. HMDS was evaluated in 2007 by the EFSA Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC). As HMDS is rapidly converted into hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) in humid air or aqueous media, the genotoxic potential of HMDS is covered by the genotoxicity data for HMDSO. The AFC Panel concluded that HMDSO was non-genotoxic. The CEF Panel concluded therefore that the mixture composed of TEOS and HMDS in a ratio of 97: 3 does not raise a safety concern for the consumer if it is used at up to 0.12% (w/w) for the production of recycled PET.

J	Dittrich, K; Sangl, R; Weigl, J				Dittrich, K; Sangl, R; Weigl, J			New dispersant systems for coating pigments	WOCHENBLATT FUR PAPIERFABRIKATION			German	Article								Pigment agglomerates have to be dispersed into primary particles in order to obtain a functional and stable high-solids coating colour of high runnability. Apart from crucially impacting the colour processing properties and the coat quality, the dispersion process has a decisive influence on the interactions between pigments and other coating colour components. Today, usually polyanions and particularly polyacrylates of high anionic charge density are being employed as dispersants. Though enhancing the dispersion performance as a positive effect anionic dispersants of this kind also entail certain drawbacks. Moreover, unwanted interactions with cationic additives tend to impair production if dispersants enter the paper manufacturing process together with coating broke or recycled coating colour. The dispersant acts as anionic trash in the system: they impair the performance of cationic aids and may give rise to production failures. Research has thus been targeted to the formulation of new dispersant systems of low charge density and which contain protective colloids to partly or entirely replace highly anionic additives. Specifically, sodium salts of hydroxycarbonic acids and protective colloids based on polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone are employed far this purpose, which perform as cobinders at the same time. A primary objective of research was to maintain current solids levels and ensure comparable viscosities. The findings are that even at coater speeds of up to 1600 m/min, dispersant systems with low charge density and which include protective colloids give equivalent dispersion performance to polyanions and may even enhance the optical properties of coated papers. Sheet forming tests were conducted of paper samples coated with above new dispersant systems in comparison to paper samples that had been coated with a highly anionic charge pigments. When faintly anionic dispersants were used, the anionic charge density in the filtrate of the repulped paper was found to decrease. This means that reprocessed broke will in this case produce less unwanted interactions with cationic additives.

Owing to its unique chemical structure, HPMC can reduce the coefficient of friction (COF) and frictional wear and thus possesses excellent lubrication properties. HPMC has good dissolvability in specific solvents. The present research focuses on the reversible dissolution reaction subsequent to the film formation of HPMC, with a view to the healing and lubrication properties of thin films. Raman spectroscopy was used to test the film-forming properties of HPMC and the dissolution characteristics of various solvents. In this study, the solvents were water, methanol, ethanol, and acetone. The results showed that the HPMC film had the highest dissolvability in water. The ball-on-disk wear test was used to analyze the lubrication properties of HPMC, and the results showed that HPMC had the same COF and lubrication properties as the original film after being subjected to the water healing treatment. The HPMC film can be reused, recycled, and refilled, making it an ideal lubricant for next-generation ecotribology.

Compositions varying from 0 to 10% mass residues were produced and evaluated in physical, mechanical and thermal tests. The addition of 10% GFRP waste showed the best results when compared to adobe without additives, demonstrated as follows: shrinkage reduction of 239%; bulk density reduction of 6%; thermal conductivity reduction of 21%; mass loss reduction when submerged in water; and compressive strength increase of 45%. Therefore, the use of GFRP residue is indicated in the manufacture of adobe to improve its physical, mechanical and thermal conductivity properties. In addition to providing a destination for a considerable quantity of the waste, the commercial value of the final product is higher due to using a residue with low degradability and high energy power due to burning during recycling.

J	Tang, KK; Millard, S; Beattie, G				Tang, Kangkang; Millard, Steve; Beattie, Greg			Technical and economical feasibility of using GGBS in long-span concrete structures	ADVANCES IN CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						concrete thermal contraction; finite element analysis	MASS CONCRETE; STRENGTH	China accounts for nearly half of the global steel production. As a waste material or a by-product in the manufacture process, a large amount of blast furnace slag is generated every year. The majority of recycled blast furnace slag is used as an additive in low-grade blended cement in China (equivalent to the UK CEM II or CEM III depending on the slag content). The cost of using ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) in such low-grade applications may not be entirely reimbursed based on market research. This paper reports an on-going project at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) which investigates the feasibility of using GGBS in long-span concrete structures by avoiding/reducing the use of crack control reinforcement. Based on a case study investigation, with up to 50% of CEM I cement replaced with GGBS, a beneficiary effect of reduced thermal contraction is achieved in long-span concrete slabs with no significant detrimental effect on early-age strengths. It is believed that this finding may be transferable from China to other Asian countries with similar climates and economic/environmental concerns.

Ceramic and porcelain goods are produced from natural materials containing a high proportion of clay minerals. And waste insulator can be used as an active additive thanks to their pozzolanic properties, or as recycled aggregate in the manufacture of mortars and concrete. This research studied the effect of different particle size of grinding waste insulator proportions on binder in cement mortar Experiments were conducted to determine the optimal replacement content and particle type to ensure that the quality of concrete products is maintained. The results indicate that the use of grinding insulator powder as an admixture for cement mortar was efficient in increasing compressive strength, workability and in reducing alkali silica reaction expansion clue to the increased amount of calcium silicate hydrates created by pozzolanic reaction. And it was apparent that the properties of mortar were different with particle size of grinding insulator powder. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The flow behaviors through the SLM working chamber are obviously significant and must be further studied to resolve these matters. In this study, we continued the studies presented previously to design a blow-to-suction device enlarged from 250 mmx250 mm to 500 mmx500 mm. The air curtain inside the SLM working chamber, instead of a parallel flow, was designed with a vertical downward blowing jet as well as two parallel suction devices. Computational and experimental fluid dynamics were conducted to simulate the flow field through the working chamber, using blowing nozzles of various shapes. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was applied to investigate the flow field and to further verify the simulation results. The flow velocity profiles inside the chamber measured via PIV agreed well with those obtained through CFD simulation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A pan-mill-type mechanochemical reactor made in our laboratory was applied to determine the mechanochemical activation of WCF. The intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds of WCF could be broken up through pan milling because of the fairly strong shearing and squeezing forces. Moreover, the simultaneous reduction of particle size and the large increment of the specific surface area of pan-milled WCF benefitted its dispersion and the interfacial adhesion with the PU matrix. Mechanochemically activated WCF could be used as a low cost but effective functional additive to enhance the melt processability and mechanical properties of PU/WCF composites. With the addition of 75-phr WCF, the heat shrinkage of the melt-reprocessed PU decreased sharply from its original 11.4 to 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tensile strength of the composites was enhanced from 10.3 to 23.2 MPa. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

A semi-batch 2 L autoclave was used, with hydrogen continuously bubbled through a slurry of rubber crumbs and a paraffinic dissolution oil under pressures from 300 to 1500 psig and temperatures of about 400 degrees C. The dissolution oil dissolved the rubber and allowed the carbon-black particles to be freed from the polymer matrix. The carbon black then acted as a hydrogenation/cracking catalyst. Under optimal reaction conditions, the yield of carbon black + inorganic additives was approximately 36%, the gas yield 1-2%, naphtha yield 8%, and the balance a product oil, part of which can be recycled as the dissolution reagent. The carbon-black product after filtering and drying had properties which were an average of those of the various grades added during tire manufacture. One-half of the inorganics could be removed by a simple acid wash if desired. The carbon black has a value more than twice that of the other products and could be the factor which would allow this process to be economically viable without subsidies.

This paper analyses the behavior of the nutritive pots made from biodegradable composites for the vegetable seedling production process, focusing on their mechanical strength properties and biodegradability. It was found that the biodegradability of composite materials obtained from a mixture of secondary cellulosic fibers, peat, and additives, is strongly influenced by the presence or absence of the rhizosphere effect and the synergistic relations set in the culture substrate between the plant roots and microorganisms, which develop permanently the recycling and solubilization of mineral nutrients. The results showed that the presence in the substrate of some complex populations made by heterotrophic bacteria favors full degradation of the pulp and lignin contained in the substrate and pots composition. Therefore, unlike the reference sample (plant-free), cultivated versions exhibited an intense biodegradation on the account of rhizosphere effect.

They offer easy processing, fulfill technological, functional and durability requirements at the same time ensuring increased bio-compatibility, recycling, and eventually lower cost. On the other hand, optical 3D printing (O3DP) is a rapid prototyping tool (and an additive manufacturing technique) being developed as a choice for efficient and low waste production method, yet currently associated with mainly petroleum-derived resins. Here we employ a single bio-based resin derived from soy beans, suitable for O3DP in the scales from nano- to macro-dimensions, which can be processed even without the addition of photoinitiator. The approach is validated using both state-of-the art laser nanolithography setup as well as a widespread table-top 3D printer - sub-micrometer accuracy 3D objects are fabricated reproducibly. Additionally, chess-like figures are made in an industrial line commercially delivering small batch production services. Such concept is believed to make a breakthrough in rapid prototyping by switching the focus of O3DP to bio-based resins instead of being restricted to conventional petroleum-derived photopolymers.

In this contribution, a facile printing strategy is followed for an in-house synthesized thermoplastic poly(ether urethane). Processing by means of fused filament fabrication, in which the difference between nozzle temperature and material-specific glass transition temperature of the polymer is kept as low as possible, allows to obtain highly shrinkable objects whose shape and thermoresponsiveness can be precisely controlled. The effectiveness of the method also applies to the printing material polylactic acid. One possible application lies in highly shrinkable objects for assembly purposes. As proof-of-concept, lightweight hands-free door openers for healthcare applications are functionally simulated and developed. Once printed, such devices shrink when heated to fit on door handles, allowing an easy assembly. At the end-of-use, a heating-initiated disassembling and mechanical recycling are proposed. In perspective, a reuse of the materials in 4D printing can contribute to the emergence of a circular economy for such highly functional materials.

The ability to pattern various materials and form 2D and 3D structures with micron/sub-micron resolution and less energy and material waste compared with standard top-down methods make laser-based printing promising for many applications, for example medical devices, sensors, and microelectronics. Assembly from liquids provides a smaller feature size than powders and has advantages over other states of matter in terms of relatively simple setup, easy handling, and recycling. However, the simplicity of the setup conceals a variety of underlying mechanisms, which cannot be identified simply according to the starting or resulting materials. This progress report surveys the various mechanisms according to the source of the material-preformed or locally synthesized. Within each category, methods are defined according to the driving force of material deposition. The advantages and limitations of each method are critically discussed, and the methods are compared, shedding light on future directions and developments required to advance this field.

Protein in SS can react with formaldehyde (HCHO), and as an additive in urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins it can reduce formaldehyde emission. Thus, SS was investigated in the present study. PS and SS were collected from two mills and characterized in terms of chemical composition, fiber length distribution, pH, and buffering capacity. MDF samples were processed according to an experimental design, in which UF resin content was reduced from 12% to 8% and replaced by SS in the range of 5%-15%. Gel time measurement showed high SS reactivity with UF resin. The SS reduced HCHO emissions by up to 68% compared to control panels, without compromising internal bond strength. The bonding effect of SS was lower than expected due to the high pH, thus the buffering capacity reduced UF performance. Moreover, sludge reduced bending performance. Dimensional stability was the greatest disadvantage of sludge panels.

One try to find the ways of replacing it by waste from related industries, such as fly ash from coal combustion in thermal power plants. The aim of the study is to prove that alternative sources of binding components can compete with commercial cement in basic quality indicators, already produced and damaging during storage without recycling. The main research method is an industrial and laboratory experiment with modeling the cementitious binders. The obtained indicators are systematized, interpreted graphically and they are the basis for decision-making. Results. The authors have proved the possibility and expediency of partial replacement of marketable cement by fly ash from coal combustion in thermal power plants with appropriate training in activators-disintegrators. The quantitative values of relationship between complex binder consumption and concrete mix strength are experimentally determined, which makes it possible to correct cement consumption while maintaining the desired quality of concrete. The role of mixing operation eves detailed to improve the strength of the mixture by comparing possible methods of mixing manually and in disintegrators. The range of expediency of preparing additives for cement was established. Findings. The addition of fly ash at joint activation with cement can be used as a binder for manufacturing concrete in certain ranges of preparation modes.

Thanks to 3D printing, structural self- weight can be reduced by topology optimization of printed elements. Moreover, further decrements of self- weight and im- provement of thermal insulating properties can be achieved by the mixture design and introduction of materials of low thermal conductivity. To date, limited knowledge on lightweight printable mixtures is available. The main objective of this study is to develop 3D printed lightweight concrete (3DPLWC) mixture, with the intention of re- placing natural aggregate with waste glass (WG) by 50 vol.-% and 10 0 vol.- %. Moreover, expanded thermoplas- tic microspheres (ETM) were incorporated into the mixture. This led to a reduction in density of the mixtures as well as the thermal conductivity by up to 40 %. Comprehensive evaluation of material's fresh properties revealed that the addition of ETM results in 3D printable material with lower yield shear stress and higher plastic viscosity by 28 % and 66 %, respectively, compared to the mixes without ETM. Moreover, improvement of shape retention, flowability, setting times, and early- hardened mixtures' properties was observed. The mechanical properties of 3DPLWC showed that the replacement of natural aggregate by 50 vol.-% WG led to enhanced flexural and com- pressive strength of the composite, while full replacement resulted in retaining or slight reduction of the mechan- ical properties.

It can tailor to the unique physiological and anatomical criteria of the patient's organs or bones through precise controlling of the structure during the 3D printing. Silicone elastomers, which is a major group of materials in many biomedical implants, have low viscosities and can be printed with a special AM platform, known as freeform 3D printing systems. The freeform 3D printing systems are composed of a supporting bath and a printing material. Current supporting matrices that are either commercially purchased or synthesized were usually disposed of after retrieval of the printed part. In this work, we proposed a new and improved supporting matrix comprises of synthesized calcium alginate microgels produced via encapsulation which can be recycled, reused, and recovered for multiple prints, hence minimizing wastage and cost of materials. The dehydration tolerance of the calcium alginate microgels was improved through physical means by the addition of glycerol and chemical means by developing new calcium alginate microgels encapsulated with glycerol. The recyclability of the heated calcium alginate microgels was also enhanced by a rehydration step with sodium chloride solution and a recovery step with calcium chloride solution via the ion exchange process. We envisaged that our reusable and recyclable biocompatible calcium alginate microgels can save material costs, time, and can be applied in various freeform 3D printing systems.

The 3D printing process via fused filament fabrication (FFF) is increasingly viewed as an interesting approach for the in-situ manufacturing of buildings and items using regolith as a feedstock material, enabling the necessary repair and recycling capabilities to ensure crew safety. In this work, we investigate the radiation shielding properties and the FFF 3D printing process of polyethylene-based composites filled with Martian regolith. The on-line tool for the assessment of radiation in space (OLTARIS) software developed by NASA was used to assess the radiation shielding effectiveness of polyethylene (PE)/regolith (RG) composites in the Martian radiation environment. A basalt powder with chemical composition similar to that of Mars soil was used as Martian regolith simulant in the 3D printing process. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the melting properties and crystallization degree of PE/RG composites at different RG concentrations, in order to analyze the effect of the simulant on the process parameters of filament extrusion and 3D printing. Low-impact Izod tests were also performed, with all PE/RG composites showing improved impact strength with respect to neat PE. Based on the DSC and Izod tests results, filaments of PE/RG composites were fabricated and used to 3D-print samples for tensile tests and 3-point bending tests. Results demonstrate the radiation shielding effectiveness of PE/RG composites and the capability of 3D-printers based on FFF to successfully manufacture components made of PE/RG composites starting from extruded filaments.

The powder of this alloy was obtained by gas atomization using recycled material (Al cans) which brings several economic and social advantages. It showed chemical composition, particle size distribution, flowability, and morphology adequate for the SLM process. Samples were produced by SLM in different build directions (0?, 45?, and 90?) with a high relative density of 99.3?99.8%. SLM processing of quasicrystal-forming Al95Fe2Cr2Ti1 powder led to the formation of a microstructure including the presence of nm-sized quasicrystalline precipitates in a dendritic ?-Al matrix mainly in the center of the molten pool while the heat-affected zones showed coarser but also nanometric quasicrystalline and crystalline phases. Similar phase formation and hardness of 180.33 HV were observed at the top and bottom of the samples, independent of the build direction. Due to the formation of ultrafine precipitates and refined grains the samples exhibited a high compressive strength at room temperature and 400 ?C. The material exhibited a remarkable 140 ? 13 MPa yield strength along with extensive compression ductility at 400 ?C, which is higher than what is observed for AlSi SLMed alloys and conventionally processed hightemperature Al alloys. These results show a new opportunity to fabricate higher-performance high-temperature quasicrystal-forming alloys with freedom of geometry design and lower cost.	[de Araujo, Aylanna P.

Among powder bed fusion technologies, one of the main branches of AM, selective laser sintering (SLS) is the second oldest one. In the last few years, a direct rival has emerged: multi jet fusion (MJF). The purpose of this work is to compare these processes throughout a systematic analysis of powder and final parts made of commercially available polyamide 12 (PA12). Differences have been spotted both on the molecular and powder scale, with end capping of the MJF feedstock together with different thermal properties of the new and recycled materials. On the other hand, flowing properties are similar among the two virgin and recycled powders, with only a significant change in the fraction of fines for SLS material. The parts produced through SLS exhibit higher Young's modulus but lower elongation at break and ultimate tensile strength if compared to the ones obtained using MJF. This confirms once more that the occurrence of postcondensation has a profound influence on the final properties. Also Charpy impact strength according to ISO 179 has been tested, confirming the literature data for SLS, but also showing higher strength in the out-of-plane direction for un-notched specimens coming from MJF. Finally, the evaluation of advanced area roughness parameters such as surface roughness, skewness and kurtosis according to ISO 25178 allows the ascertainment of subtle differences arising in parts with different positioning on the build platform, possibly due to the inks employed in the MJF process.

Although large particles are removed when recycling, smaller oxidised particles (the size of the specified powder for the machine) and oxide residue (<10 mu m) are not removed and become incorporated into subsequent builds on powder reuse. This paper considers the effect these oxidised particles may have on part integrity and how they affect mechanical failure. In this research, grade 23 Ti-6Al-4 V metal powder was artificially oxidised to produce a range of interference colours that correspond to specific oxide thicknesses. Powder characterisation established the oxygen wt% of each coloured powder. Yellow and blue powder were chosen for further investigation as in the context of this study, they represent low (0.4 wt%) and high (0.7 wt%) oxygen levels respectively. Tensile builds were produced using SLM with a known feedstock layer, part way up the build, formed of a blend of oxidised and virgin particles. Tensile tests were performed for each build to evaluate the failure modes. Microscopy techniques were used to examine the material near the fractured region, including chemical composition and semiquantification of the oxygen levels, allowing any microstructural and chemical changes to be investigated. It was shown that the region doped with oxidised particles negatively affected the mechanical properties of the final build, as they produce mechanical (oxide films/residue) and chemical flaws (interstitial elements). Unless these particles can be removed from recycled feedstock their effects will limit the reuse of powder, especially in safety critical industries, significantly increasing the costs of components produced by this route.

Polymeric composite materials have the base matrix of polymers containing the reinforcement fillers and additives. They have a wide array of applications ranging from packaging, spacecrafts, smart or specialized polymers to nano based textile material and biological implants. Different polymers used as matrix material to prepare composites with improved mechanical, thermal and electrical properties includes plastics of different constitution like polyester, polyamide etc. Growing public concern about environmental pollution has led to development and design of biodegradable composite materials. Knowledge and implementation of relevant regulatory guidelines are vital from safety and environmental viewpoint. New methods are being devised for polymerization using super critical CO2 along with additives. They have potential market applications along with the elimination of toxic moieties generated in conventional manufacturing techniques. Green chemistry concepts may be utilized for eco-friendly materials and to minimize the toxic implications of organic chemicals such as toluene, methylene chloride which pose potential risks to human health. The holistic and concerted efforts are needed for the development of new composites for minimization of environmental impact of polymer composite production. The life cycle assessment is of paramount importance at every stage of a product's life from initial synthesis to final disposal for a sustainable environment. The regulatory assessment and monitoring procedures as per the National/International guidelines are required to be reviewed wherever needed. They must be updated periodically depending upon the composition, intended usage conditions in order to promote clean processing, applications, biodegradation, recycling and reprocessing.	[Sharma, V.

Green cement composite concept reinforced by graphite nano-engineered particle suspension for infrastructure renewal material	COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING			English	Article						Nano-structures; Recycling; Mechanical properties; Physical properties; Green cement composite; Infrastructure renewal material; Graphite nano-engineered particle suspension	MARBLE POWDER; BRICK POWDER; FLY-ASH; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CONCRETE	Renewal of infrastructure is significant concern in most countries around the globe. Sustainable renewal of infrastructure needs an innovative concept that is inexpensive, quickly hardened, and strength gained at the early age, such as green cement composite concept explained in the study. This article aims to present the physical properties of green cement composite concept reinforced by the graphite nano-engineered particle suspension (GNPS) by means of sustainability, stiffness, hydraulic lateral formwork pressure, and strength gain at early age. Results of numerous tests measured, such as the optical atomic absorbance spectra, the initial and final stiffness of time, the flow, and the early age compressive strength of green composite concept, are discussed. In all tests, the usability of GNPS is displayed as innovative original nano-engineered-suspension for infrastructure renewal material and for manufacturing of green cement composite concept effectively. For that reason, the results of this work could bring new materials to cement and concrete producers, specifiers, and end users; and new market could emerge to provide the GNP and the GNPS in additive and admixture forms.

J	Maciel, VG; Wales, DJ; Seferin, M; Sans, V				Maciel, Vinicius Goncalves; Wales, Dominic J.; Seferin, Marcus; Sans, Victor			Environmental performance of 3D-Printing polymerisable ionic liquids	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Life cycle assessment; 3D-printing; Additive manufacturing; Ionic liquids; Stereolithography; Polymers	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; POLY(IONIC LIQUID)S; SUSTAINABILITY; GREEN	This work presents a "cradle-to-gate" Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 3D-printing polymerisable ionic liquids (PILs) using digital light projection (DLP). It is based on primary data from environmental emissions, wastewater, chemical components, and manufacturing of PIL based devices. The results indicate that the printing process does not significantly exacerbate the environmental impacts. However, it is shown that excellent opportunities for further mitigation of the life cycle impacts of PILs can be realised are by practising reagent recovery, which reduces the amount of reagents emitted as waste, and by reduction/recycling of solvents used for cleaning the 3D part. The major impact contributor in the 3D-printing of PILs is the synthesis of the IL monomers. The effective reduction of solvent consumption and recovery significantly improves the impact of the synthetic process. This work focuses on the employment of the 3-butyl-l-vinylimidazolium [BVim] cation, with the non-coordinating and hydrophobic bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide [NTf2](-) anion as the counter anion. The polymerisable monomer IL has comparable impact compared to the analogous non-polymerisable 3-butyl-l-methylimidazolium [NTf2]ionic liquid, thus potentially allowing for the more efficient use of the ionic liquid properties by immobilization in solid phases. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that switching the anion from [NTf2]-to dicyanamide [N(CN2)](-) significantly decreases the impacts in all categories evaluated for PIL production. This work represents the first phase toward quantitative LCA data generation for the process of 3D-printing ionic liquids, which will be great support for decision making during design of PIL 3D-printing processes at a laboratory scale.

The effects of using waste fibers obtained from fiberboard wet process, recycled paper process, and cellulose process as adhesive additives on some physical and mechanical properties and formaldehyde emission of adhesives and plywood panels were examined. Three major types of fibers, primary fibrous sludge (PFS), primary cellulose sludge (PCS), and deinked paper sludge (DPS) were characterized and evaluated as adhesive fillers in plywood manufacturing. UF adhesive filled with 15 wt% wheat flour (WF) was used as a reference sample. Plywood panels were made of formulations with urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin filled with three different concentrations of fibers, 1 wt%, 3 wt%, and 5 wt%. Compared with DPS and PCS, PFS had a higher lignin and extractives content, and lower pH. These characteristics make PFS a better adhesive filler for plywood than DPS or PCS. Panels with UF/PFS, UF/DPS and UF/PCS formulations at a sludge content of 1-5 wt%, 1 wt% and 3 wt%, respectively had higher wet shear strengths than those made with the control sample. It was also found that the use of fibers obtained from different processes in the UF adhesive composition decreased the formaldehyde emission of panels. The PFS, PCS, and DPS reduced formaldehyde emissions by up to 27.8, 24.9, and 19.4%, respectively compared with control panels, without compromising the shear strength. The shear strength of plywood panels with all investigated sludges met the requirements of the EN 314-2 standard.

Performance evaluation of warm mix asphalt involving natural zeolite and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) for sustainable pavement construction	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						Warm mix asphalt; Natural zeolite; Reclaimed asphalt pavement; Stiffness modulus; Cracking resistance; Moisture sensitivity; Rutting; Fatigue behaviour	SYNTHETIC ZEOLITE; HIGH PERCENTAGES; WMA ADDITIVES; TECHNOLOGIES; MIXTURES; BEHAVIOR	The purpose of this paper is to present an experimental study to characterize the mechanical behaviour of warm mix asphalt (WMA) mixtures designed with Chilean natural zeolite and different amounts of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) for sustainable pavement construction. Five WMA mixtures were evaluated and compared with one reference hot mix asphalt (HMA). Two WMA mixtures were fabricated with 0.3% and 0.6% w/a natural zeolite; and three WMA mixtures were fabricated with 0.6% w/a natural zeolite and 10%, 20% and 30% RAP content. The binder contents and volumetric properties were obtained according to Chilean standards. The mechanical properties evaluated were stiffness modulus, cracking resistance, moisture sensitivity, resistance to rutting and fatigue behaviour. The results showed that WMA mixtures with natural zeolite can be manufactured at a temperature of 20 degrees C lower than reference HMA, fulfilling the design specifications. Likewise, recycled asphalt mixtures can be fabricated at a lower temperature using natural zeolite, showing good performance properties to be used for sustainable pavement construction.

Within this context, this study aims to give a second life cycle to phosphogypsum (PG) waste, which is a by-product from phosphoric acid manufacture, as useful resources. This study evaluates the sustainability of this harmful waste, which is accumulated in large stockpiles and becomes hazardous during storage, and to stabilize bentonite-based concrete intended for road construction. The effect of raw bentonite (Ca-Na montmorillonite), PG, and lime on the properties of cementitious materials has been investigated through various tests. The properties examined include chemistry (X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry), mineralogy (X-ray Powder Diffraction and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), calorimetry (Differential Thermal Analysis/Thermogravimetry) and microstructure (Scanning Electron Microscopy) of the mortar based on different mixtures of bentonite, PG and lime. The result show that lime and PG addition involves in the formation of new nanocrystalline phases and the disappearance of certain minerals as portlandite. Calcium silicate hydrate gel appeared in the mixture with 8% of lime, whereas stratlingite was neoformed in the mixture with 8% of lime and 8% of PG. These nanocrystalline phases are responsible for enhancing mechanical strength through the pozzoloanic reaction.

This review includes an evaluation of the enviromental impacts of agency approval as required by the National Enviromental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The FDA's environmental review process begins when an industry sponsor provides the agency with an environmental assessment containing information for the public record about the manufacture, use, and disposal of the proposed food packaging material. The agency uses this information to evaluate whether approval of this material may have significant environmental effects, including impacts on solid waste management (source reduction, recycling, incineration, and landfilling). The magnitude of the solid waste problem today creates a new context for assessing the significance of impacts on disposal. For some actions involving food packaging, more detailed information on disposal is needed to determine whether there will be significant impacts on solid waste management. The majority of the FDA actions involving food packaging will not have adverse effects on solid waste management, and for these actions environmental requirements are abbreviated. For petitions that may affect solid waste management, the FDA strives to do a technically sound and complete analysis of potential impact to meet the letter and spirit of NEPA.

It is common practice in industry to process a mix of recycled and virgin PA12 powder; however it is not yet fully understood how the Laser Sintering process parameters influence the microstructural composition for this mixture, namely the degree of crystallinity, the porosity characteristics and the distribution of the pores within the sintered parts. In this work X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is used to investigate the porosity of tensile bars printed flatwise using a 50/50 mix of used and virgin PA12 processed with different Laser Sintering energy densities (EDs). Analysis of the pores characteristics and image processing of the CT-slices parallel to the building platform provide insights into the link between Laser Sintering process parameters, pores formation and their arrangement into the sintered polymer for different energy density levels. This information combined with the crystallinity values measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry, gives a complete picture of the microstructure of the sintered material and its link with the resulting tensile properties.

In the last few decades much effort has been devoted worldwide to extend the applications of such materials by conferring on them new properties through mixing and blending with different additives. In this latter context, nanocomposites have recently offered new exciting possibilities. This review discusses the successful use of nanostructured dispersed substrates in designing new stimuli-responsive nanocomposites; in particular, it provides an updated description of the synthetic routes to prepare nanostructured systems having the typical properties of thermoplastic polymers (continuous matrix), but showing enhanced optical, conductive, and thermal features dependent on the dispersion topology. The controlled nanodispersion of functional labeled clays, noble metal nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes is here evidenced to play a key role in producing hybrid thermoplastic materials that have been used in the design of devices, such as NLO devices, chemiresistors, temperature and deformation sensors.

Kaan			The distribution and role of nanoclay in lignocellulose-polymer blends	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							WOOD-PLASTIC COMPOSITES; BIOMASS; MATRIX; HDPE	Lignocellulose-polymer blends (LCPBs), particularly those manufactured from wood biomass and recycled plastics, have gained significance as a green alternative to concrete and wood. In the present work, we investigate the mechanisms as to how nanoclay additives improve water-sorption resistance and durability in LCPBs. The microstructure of our extruded and molded clay-redcedar-polyethylene blends are imaged by micro-computed tomography (m-CT), a promising technique for the characterization of composites. This recent and powerful 3D micro-imaging technique allows noninvasive revelation of the macroscopic to microscopic interactions between different components in a composite. Specifically, our m-CT study reveals the smearing of clay nanoplatelets over the lignocellulose domains with partial impregnation into the lignocellulose void network. The m-CT images also suggest partial disintegration of wood cellular structure in clay-added LCPBs. We attribute this modification to penetration of organocations from clay to lignocellulose, as validated by vibrational spectroscopy. To gain further insight, we also monitor the water-sorption kinetics. The kinetics revalidates the well-established role of clay in impeding water's diffusion. In addition, our analysis of the kinetics reveals a novel role of clay in water-sorption resistance. The clay, smeared over hygroscopic lignocellulose particles serves as a sealant and blocks the entry of water.	[Karumuri, Sriharsha; Kalkan, A.

The same incentives are stimulating interest among scientists, horticulturists, entrepreneurs, and the minerals industries in the potential for utilization of various inorganic by-products, from cement, rock, aggregate, power plant and steel manufacturing operations, as beneficial additives to these organics. The resulting 'bio-mineral' products will provide stabilized organic materials augmented with mineral components useful in agriculture, horticulture, landscaping and reclamation. Some form of treatment will be required to remove pathogenic organisms that are present in primary organic constituents of such bio-mineral products. Existing federal standards ("40CFR503 for Code of federal Regulations") for biosolids include criteria for assessing pathogen destruction achieved by several treatment processes. The applicability and appropriateness of these criteria to organic and biomineral products, not containing biosolids, is discussed along with the need for test refinements appropriate to new technologies. Potential disease transmission pathways and case reports involving emerging pathogens, e.g., E. coli O157:H7, salmonellae, Cryptosporidium parvum, suggest that environmental health implications of farm and food production practices involving animal manure be reviewed and evaluated in a manner equivalent to that of biosolids. Specific information on pathogen survival and destruction relative to current and developing organics and bio-minerals recycling processes is needed to support development of guidelines for appropriate practices. Depending on the treatment process and the targeted mineral composition of the final product, inorganic constituents may be added prior to, during, or after organics processing. The sequence of mineral augmentation in organics processing has the potential to influence the quality of the product, but more research is urgently needed to optimize these benefits and to support recommendations that promote environmental and public health.

Initiated by the group of Gramazio Kohler Research at ETH Zurich and the Self-Assembly Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, this digital fabrication approach fosters a combination of cutting-edge robotic fabrication technology and low-grade building material, shifting the focus from precise assembly of known parts towards controlled aggregation of granular material such as gravel or rocks. Since the structures in this process are produced without additional formwork, are fully reversible, and are produced from local or recycled materials, this pursuit offers a radical new approach to sustainable, economical and structurally sound building construction. The resulting morphologies allow for a convergence of novel aesthetic and structural capabilities, enabling a locally differentiated aggregation of material under digital guidance, and featuring high geometrical flexibility and minimal material waste. This paper considers (1) fundamental research parameters such as design computation and fabrication methods, (2) first results of physical experimentation, and (3) the architectural implications of this research for a unified, material-driven digital design and fabrication process. Full-scale experimentation demonstrates that it is possible to erect building-sized structures that are larger than the work-envelope of the digital fabrication setup.

J	Cordova, L; Campos, M; Tinga, T				Cordova, Laura; Campos, Monica; Tinga, Tiedo			Revealing the Effects of Powder Reuse for Selective Laser Melting by Powder Characterization	JOM			English	Article							METAL POWDERS; TI-6AL-4V	In a selective laser melting process, it is common to reuse the powder in consecutive cycles of the route because it is more sustainable and cost effective. However, it is unknown whether reusing the material has an influence on the process. In this paper, Inconel 718, Ti6Al4V, AlSi10Mg and Scalmalloy are characterized to determine the impact of reusing powders on the additive manufacturing (AM) process under an argon high-purity atmosphere. Virgin powders were taken from the suppliers and compared to powders that had been used in the process for a long period of time with periodic rejuvenation'. A well-structured characterization procedure, combining many existing techniques, is proposed, determining changes in the morphology, composition (chemical and microstructure) and flowability. Clear differences between the virgin and used state are revealed by the characterizations; AlSi10Mg, appears to be the most sensitive to reuse with changes in particle size distribution and morphology, and with an increase in the oxygen content. The main contribution of this paper is providing insight into the effects of reuse for four commonly used AM powders, by means of a simple but well-structured method that links the particle feature characterization process to the flowability of metal AM powders. The provided insights enable enhanced decision-making on recycling and reuse of powder for specific AM processes.

J	Earle, M; De Portu, G; De Vos, E				Earle, Matthew; De Portu, Giuliano; De Vos, Elizabeth			Agar ultrasound phantoms for low-cost training without refrigeration	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article							RESIDENTS	Introduction: Ultrasound is a technique that can be utilised to augment procedures to increase their safety and efficacy, but requires that health professionals be trained to use this imaging modality before it can be implemented. With the extremely high cost of manufactured phantoms, homemade alternatives are popular substitutes. Gelatine is commonly used as a matrix to suspend analogues and mimic tissue, but other substrates like ground meat can also be used. Both of these substrates require refrigeration and are subject to spoiling. Our research was designed to evaluate whether agar models would be superior to traditional Gelatine models in their sustainability and whether they would produce ultrasound images adequate for training. Methods: Agar models of varying formulas (percent agar by weight with certain additives varied) were tested for acceptable fidelity to real tissue, ultrasound image quality, and durability compared to gelatine models and human tissue. Results: A five percent by-mass agar model augmented with small amounts of suspended wheat flour presented as a model that could generate an ultrasound image that remarkably resembled that of real tissue. This agar model does not require refrigeration, is resistant to spoiling and desiccation, mimics tissue texture well, is durable enough to withstand high-volume training, and can be recycled to make new models. Conclusion: Agar phantoms are easy to make, do not require refrigeration, and have multiple distinct advantages over gelatine models for ultrasound training in austere conditions.

High-solids enzymatic saccharification (HSES) is a straightforward approach to develop an industrially deployable sugar platform. Economic incentives such as reduced capital and operational expenditure along with environmental benefits in the form of reduced effluent discharge makes this strategy more lucrative for exploitation. However, HSES suffers from the drawback of non-linear and disproportionate sugar yields with increased substrate loadings. To overcome this bottleneck, researchers tend to perform HSES at high enzyme loadings. Nonetheless, the production costs of cellulases are one of the key contributors that impair the entire process economics. This review highlights the relentless efforts made globally to attain a high-titer of sugars and their fermentation products by performing efficient HSES at low cellulase loadings. In this context, technical innovations such as advancements in new pretreatment strategies, next-generation cellulase cocktails, additives, accessory enzymes, novel reactor concepts and enzyme recycling studies are especially showcased. This review further covers new insights, learnings and prospects in the area of lignocellulosic bioprocessing.

However, a high volume of the industrial production has generated a considerable amount of waste materials which have a number of adverse impacts on the environment. In this regard, the marble industry produces a huge amount of waste in the last decades and grows significantly in time. The marble waste is generally a highly polluting type of industrial wastes due to its highly alkaline nature and its manufacturing and processing techniques, all of which impose serious health threats to the surroundings. In this study, effects of waste marble on some durability properties such as water absorption and permeability, chloride penetration and carbonation, sulphate attack and abrasion resistance, and lastly performance at high temperature and freezing and thawing cycles of conventional or self-compacting concrete were investigated. As a result, it was found out that the use of waste marble in the conventional or self-compacting concrete mix as an admixture material or aggregate is suitable as it can improve durability properties of the concrete. Especially, properties of water absorption & permeability and resistance of chloride penetration & sulphate attack were improved by incorporation of waste marble in concrete. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Here, we report a novel type of enzyme immobilization strategy utilizing additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing). The shape and structures of carbon fiber reinforced polylactic acid (C-PLA) scaffolds could be flexibly designed and printed (cube, sphere, and pyramid shapes and microfluidic reactors). After chemical modification with piranha solution, peracetic acid, and a silane coupling agent, the resultant scaffolds achieved a high specific surface area (2.2 m(2)/g, a 3.63-fold increase) with an abundance of surface-active groups. As a proof of concept, four kinds of enzymes (penicillin G acylase (PGA), protease, glycosidase, and lipase) were successfully immobilized on the chemically modified 3D scaffolds. The final yield was 185.6 mM for the reaction catalyzed by PGA, and the final yield of lactosucrose reached 142 g/L for the glycosidase-catalyzed reaction. After 10 cycles, the retention rate of enzymatic activity was 88% for PGA and 92.8% for glycosidase. Thus, tunable 3D-printed enzyme immobilization carriers offer a promising solution to building a simple platform that is low cost and flexible enough to accommodate various enzymes and reactors for industrial applications.

In this study, we collected plastic express packaging bags from major express companies in China to investigate phthalates in them. Infrared spectra indicated that all these samples were made from polyethylene but with different carbonyl index (CI) values. Total phthalates (Sigma Phthalates) concentrations in these samples ranged from 11.16 to 309.70 mu g g(-1). Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, and di-isobutyl phthalate were predominant phthalates. The leaching amounts of Sigma Phthalates after 48 h ranged from 181.44 to 5320.64 mu g g(-1). The leaching amounts of Sigma Phthalates significantly positively related to Sigma Phthalates concentrations of samples, while the leaching ratios presented opposite trends. Concentrations and leaching amounts of Sigma Phthalates and major phthalates were significantly higher in samples from high CI value company group than those from low CI value company group. The results of our study indicate that plastic express packaging bags could be a critical source of phthalates. The involving of recycled plastics during the manufacture of plastic express packaging bags may influence the content and composition of phthalates in them and also increase the releasing risk of phthalates.

Typically, it must be reinforced with steel rebars, yet it still suffers from potential corrosion issues. This work proposes and examines a new method for improving the bending stiffness of cementitious beams by reinforcing with 3D printed plastic TPMS-Primitive scaffolds. Three concrete beams of the same size - including non-reinforced, reinforced with one-layer, and two-layer bioinspired thin-walled molds - are designed and fabricated for three-point bending tests and comparisons. The simulation is found to be in good agreement with the experiment in terms of stress-strain curves and crack propagation. Results show the improved load-bearing capacity of the concrete beam reinforced with 3D-printed TPMS-Primitive shells. The peak load of the two-layer TPMS-Primitive reinforced beam is 35% and 125% higher than that of the one-layer reinforced beam and the non-reinforced concrete beam, respectively. Furthermore, the TPMS-Primitive reinforced concrete beams reveal a smooth softening behavior in bending and increase ductility as well. The scalable and sustainable production of such beams for construction applications could be realized by a combination of 3D printing techniques and recycled plastic.

The purification process of ETBE involves the separation of ETBE, mixed C4 hydrocarbons and unreacted ethanol. The unreacted ethanol forms azeotropic mixtures with ETBE that are difficult to separate by distillation. In this work, a comparative study between the conventional process to produce ETBE and two alternative intensified processes is presented by means of process simulation in Aspen Plus. One of the alternative methods for improving the separation and purification section of ETBE is the use of a hybrid distillation-pervaporation process with alcohol-selective membranes, which allows to reach the target ETBE purity (95.2 wt%) with a lower energy consumption and at the same time the permeate stream, with a high ethanol content, is recycled back to the reaction section. Alternatively, the production of ETBE by means of reactive distillation is analyzed for the same basis of calculation. The results show that the reactive distillation allows a significant increase in the conversion of the reactants, but in contrast the energy consumption is higher than in the other processes evaluated.

J	Sambucci, M; Valente, M				Sambucci, Matteo; Valente, Marco			Influence of Waste Tire Rubber Particles Size on the Microstructural, Mechanical, and Acoustic Insulation Properties of 3D-Printable Cement Mortars	CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN			English	Article						3D Printing; Tire Recycling; Rubber Particle Size; Print Quality; Microstructural Investigation; Mechanical Properties; Sound Insertion Loss	CRUMB RUBBER; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; CONCRETE; PERFORMANCE; AGGREGATE; GLASS	3D printing technologies of construction materials are gaining ground in the building industry. As well documented in the literature, these advanced manufacturing methodologies aim to reduce work-related injuries and materials waste, enhancing architectural flexibility which would enable more sophisticated designs for engineering and aesthetic purposes. In this framework, the development of functional and eco-sustainable printable materials represents an extremely attractive challenge for research, promoting digital fabrication to reach its maximum cost-effective and technological potentials. The use of recycled tire rubber particles in 3D printable Portland-based compounds is an exclusive contribution in this field. This line of research aims to integrate the well-known engineering performances of rubber-cement materials with the advanced peculiarities of additive manufacturing methodologies. As an innovative contribution, the authors propose here a detailed study on the possible relationship between rubber particle size and technological properties of the 3D printable mix. Specifically, two groups of continuous size grading polymer aggregates (0-1 mm rubber powder and 1-3 mm rubber granules as fine and coarse fractions, respectively) were analyzed in terms of impact on rheology, print quality, microstructure, mechanical properties, and acoustic insulation performance. Concerning the print quality, rubber aggregates altered the fluidity of the fresh mix, improving the adhesion between the printed layers and therefore enhancing the mechanical isotropy in the post-hardening sample. A remarkable influence of the rubber gradation on the compounds' behaviour was found in hardened properties. By comparing the rubberized compounds, the fine polymer fraction shows greater interfacial cohesion with the cement paste. However, more significant mechanical strength loss was found due to a greater reduction in density and increased porosity degree. On the other hand, mortars doped with larger rubber particles tend to have a higher unit weight, finest pore distribution, minor mechanical strength drop, and higher ductility but worse interface binding with the matrix. Regarding the acoustic insulation properties, a proper balance between rubber powder and granules in the mixes allows to obtain comparable/superior performance compared to plain mortar but the effect of the aggregate size is strongly dependent on the sound frequency range investigated. Future findings revolve around applicability studies of these formulations in civil and architectural fields, benefiting from the design flexibility of 3D printing.

The RSS was scoured firstly in strongly alkaline electrolyzed water (SAEW, pH >= 11.5) consisting mainly of hydroxyl ions by boiling for 30 min and then treated by the traditional scouring procedure (without alkaline compounds), resulting in refined silk floss. The recycled SAEW containing sericin was separated by ultrafiltration into a retentate with a range of high molecular mass values accounting for 10% (w/w) of the cocoon shell and the filtrate was separated by nanofiltration into a purified H2O filtrate and a retentate containing oligopeptides and free amino acids, which can be used directly as food additives or in biological growth media. The ultrafiltration retentate was hydrolyzed by papain under three different conditions into three groups of sericin peptides with high, middle or low molecular mass. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and gel permeation high-performance liquid chromatography (GP-HPLC) showed the molecular mass of these sericin peptides was in the range 0.2-60, 0.2 -30 and 0.2-15 kDa. These clean products have a variety of applications, including coating materials for surface modification, cell culture media and food additives. The procedure described here could be applied to the manufacture of silk floss quilts and the process of refining raw silk, which results in three clean products of the silk protein fibroin (i.e. stripped of sericin) and reduces environmental pollution from scouring waste containing sericin.

Paraffin, synthetic wax, vegetable wax, rosin wax and other additives are blended according to certain proportion, and the mixture is modified by amidation process. The hard, high strength and tenacity wax-based material is produced, and its machining performance is studied. The result suggests that the mechanical properties of this material is better than paraffin, it possesses the properties of high hardness, high strength and high ductility and toughness. This material can meet the machining requirements, it is a kind of ideal substitute material for consuming steel in machining technical training. The production of this material can solve the high consumption and high cost problems in application. Steel, one of the known mechanical cutting materials, is widely used as engineering material. But in particular usage, such as the processing technology of universal machine tool, the training of numerical control processing technology and so on, because the cutting workpiece is not used as a forced mechanical component, the steel, as a mechanical material, not only lead to a great waste of a lot of steel, but also lead to the higher wearing of tool and higher consumption of power, which is caused by cutting steel. All of these factors make the machining technology training have been in an operation of high-consumption and high-cost. In China, more than 1000,000 tons steel and more than a billion yuan will be consumed by all kinds of mechanical engineering training in institutions and the skills training for employees machinery manufacturing enterprise. So for construction of a economical society, it has a great significance to develop a substitute material with lower price of raw material and simple preparation equipment and technology, which has no harm to environment and can be recycled repeatedly, and has the same mechanical cutting performance with steel. At present, in foreign countries, the sample wax is produced for mechanical cutting, and in our country, the preparation methods of high hardness wax and the effect of additive on paraffin hardness are introduced by many documents([1-3]). However, the wax-based material for mechanical cutting is not contained in any relevant research. To this end, we carry out research in this area.

Formaldehyde remains a key, large volume industrial chemical which is ubiquitous to household, commercial, aviation, pharmaceutical and automotive products due to its high reactivity and versatility. Critical analysis, of the various technological approaches used to manufacture formaldehyde, characteristics of silver catalysts employed, process conditions, and performance values has been presented. The three common plant types are almost complete conversion (BASF type); incomplete conversion followed by distillation (ICI type); and the off-gas recycle process Which dominates world production due to its extensive use in China. Polycrystalline silver remains the most popular catalyst, with only minimal use of alternate supported catalysts or gauze materials. Catalyst physical properties such as bulk density, purity, mechanical strength, size fraction and shape are important in relation to overall formaldehyde synthesis performance. Process yields majorly range from ca. 82 to 92% and catalyst lifetimes vary from 4 weeks to 12 months. There is a research need to not only raise overall yields consistently to in excess of 90% but to also maximize catalyst life. Aspects which should be taken into account include: purification of feed components; development of a systematic means for catalyst bed design; improvement and standardization of process configuration; equipment optimization; investigation of the benefits of feed or catalyst additives; protection of the catalyst bed from poisoning events and discovery of preferred process operating conditions. In the near term, focusing on optimization of the current formaldehyde synthesis industry is seen as more prospective from a commercial point of view, than longer term investigation of alternate pathways for manufacturing formaldehyde from methane or carbon dioxide which may riot be viable for at least a decade.

Impact damage resistance of 3D printed continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites using fused deposition modelling	COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING			English	Article						3D printing; Fused deposition modelling; Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites; Impact strength; Failure analysis	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CHARPY IMPACT; STACKING-SEQUENCE; CONTINUOUS CARBON; PROCESS PARAMETERS; BEHAVIOR; PLA; POLYMERS; STRENGTH; PREDICTION	Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a promising additive manufacturing technology and an alternative of conventional processes for the fabrication of fibre reinforced composites due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs) are becoming more significant in industrial applications due to their inherit advantages such as excellent mechanical performance, recycling and potential lightweight structures [1,2]. However, a major concern affecting the efficient use of 3D printed composites is the effect of impact damage on the structural integrity, compared to conventional pre-preg composites. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of build orientation, layer thickness and fibre volume content on the impact performance of 3D printed continuous carbon, glass, and Kevlar fibre reinforced nylon composites, manufactured by FDM technique. Charpy impact tests are carried out to determine impact strength. SEM images of fractured surfaces are examined to assess failure mechanics of the different configurations. It is observed that the effect of layer thickness of nylon samples on the impact performance was different for flat and on-edge samples. Impact strength increases as layer thickness increases in flat samples but, conversely, it decreases in on-edge samples, depicting a more brittle fracture. In addition, the results show that impact strength increases as fibre volume content increases in most cases. Glass fibre reinforced samples exhibits the highest impact strength and carbon fibre reinforced samples the lowest one and similar to nylon performance. Furthermore, on-edge reinforced samples exhibit higher values of impact strength than flat reinforced samples. Finally, the results obtained demonstrate that impact strength exhibited by 3D printed composites are significantly higher than the usual 3D printed thermoplastics and, in some cases, even better than common pre-preg materials.

This study aims to recycle plastic waste by manufacturing wood-plastic composites and to improve its mechanical properties by using additives, coupling agents, and lubricants. These composites are prepared by mixing 40-70% of wood flour with 20-25% of a polymer matrix. Wood was degraded at 220 & DEG;C, and then the composites were processed at 50 & DEG;C. The manufacturing process carried out in the study involved wood waste meshing, drying, shredding, drying, trimming, filling, blending, compounding, and extrusion moulding. The compounding of composites was accomplished in twin-screw extruders. Once the mixture was uniformly mixed, its final shape was given by a two-step extrusion moulding. Previously, researchers aimed at enhancing the mechanical properties of the composites, but our research focus was to improve their durability for different industrial applications. The results suggest that the impact strength is 17 MPa with 50% of wood powder ratio while the maximum value for the tensile strength is 32.5 MPa. About 50% of an increase in wood powder resulted in 8.1% bending strength increase from 26.1 to 32.8 MPa. Reducing the plastic matrix and the wood-particles water swelling ratio resulted in better mechanical properties. The wood species also affected the mechanical properties with their excellent dimensional stability and less variability. A high proportion of wood fibre tends to increase its steady-state torque and viscosity. The mechanical properties against different wood-flour proportions indicate that composite materials exhibit superior water swelling behaviour and extrusion quality.

In the sector of alcoholic beverages and, in particular, of wine, plastic bottles are used sporadically. Glass bottles or other economic solutions such as laminated cardboard containers or so-called bag-in-boxes are regularly preferred. However, the high ease of use, lightness, recyclability and low cost of plastic materials are the main reasons that are fueling interest especially in wine producers. Poly (ethylene terephthalate) bottles have recently been introduced to the market, although their success has been limited by poor gas impermeability and above all by their recognized high environmental footprint. Barrier can be improved by oxygen scavenger and plasma coating. Environmental footprint is rather low when recycled but that is not well possible with scavenger. Bioplastic materials offer an interesting alternative to fossil-based plastics, combining most of their technical advantages with a lower environmental impact. However, they are more expensive and complex to process. In addition, mechanical and barrier properties are often less than for conventional polymers. In this work, therefore, the development of bioplastic bottles with low gas permeation by stretch blow molding was studied. Poly (lactic acid)-polybutylene succinate blends have been modified by adding additives that obstruct the passage of gaseous molecules through the wall of the bottle. The studies have in particular concerned the extrusion and characterization of bioplastic compounds, the injection molding of preforms, and the blowing of bottles. The results obtained showed that it is possible to obtain low permeation bioplastic bottles, which are an ecological alternative to conventional solutions for packaging.

J	Soltani-Tehrani, A; Pegues, J; Shamsaei, N				Soltani-Tehrani, Arash; Pegues, Jonathan; Shamsaei, Nima			Fatigue behavior of additively manufactured 17-4 PH stainless steel: The effects of part location and powder re-use	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Fatigue; Laser beam powder bed fusion (LB-PBF); Defects; Powder recycling; Part location	SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; FLOW PROPERTIES; TI-6AL-4V; SIZE	In laser beam powder bed fusion (LB-PBF), an additive manufacturing method, powder is often reconditioned and re-used multiple times to save cost. Considering the assumption that powder characteristics may affect the LB-PBF part quality, it is essential to understand how such characteristics change by re-using the powder and how these changes affect the mechanical properties of the fabricated part. Therefore, this study systematically investigates the effect of powder re-use on the powder characteristics, microstructural features, and mechanical properties of LB-PBF 17-4 precipitation hardening (PH) stainless steel (SS) specimens in both as-built and machined surface conditions. In addition, the dependency of microstructural features and mechanical properties on the location of the specimen on the build plate and how the powder re-use affects such location dependencies are studied. No significant effect of powder re-use and location dependency was observed on tensile or fatigue behavior of LB-PBF specimens in the as-built surface condition. However, an improved fatigue resistance, specifically in the high cycle regime, was observed for machined specimens fabricated by heavily re-used powder. In addition, considerable location dependency on the fatigue behavior was observed for machined specimens fabricated by unused powder. This location dependency, however, decreased with increasing powder re-use. The observed dependency of the fatigue behavior to the location and the improved fatigue resistance are explained by the better flowability and less compressibility of the re-used powder due to the decreased number of very fine particles and agglomerates within the powder batch. These improved powder characteristics resulted in a more uniform powder distribution on the build plate and less and smaller defects in the specimens.

J	Chaudhary, R; Upadhyaya, S; Sangal, VK				Chaudhary, Ritu; Upadhyaya, Sushant; Sangal, Vikas Kumar			A Parametric Study on the HDPE/PP and Marble Slurry Waste Utilisation Using Single Screw Extruder	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION			English	Article						Extrusion; recycling; HDPE; air pollution; marble slurry; water pollution	PLASTICS; MANAGEMENT	Due to the increased socio-economic development, the manufacturing of different products based on various polymers for different applications such as space crafts, airplanes, automobiles, boats, and sports equipment are increasing continuously. This huge increase in solid polymer commodities is also creating the extravagant quantity of solid waste polymers (SWPs) due to their non-degradable characteristics. These SWPs, for example, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and nylon, etc., are used frequently in various applications and create new challenges to the industries, government, as well as end-users for systematic waste recycling/recovery in an eco-friendly manner. Moreover, in this modernisation era, almost all marble industries are also facing a huge problem as marble slurry (MS) yields a great burden not only due to its limited degradability characteristics but also wider environmental hazard towards water bodies, and rivers. Fine particles in the range size of 45-300 micron in the MS create air pollution which in turn increases breathing problems. Moreover, it also creates an ecological adverse impact on soil fertility and reduces the percolation rate of rain water which in turn reduces the recharging of groundwater. Therefore, keeping in view the above facts, the simultaneous recycling of HDPE, PP and marble slurry is adopted through single screw extrusion in order to reduce the burden on the environment. Moreover, the effect of various process parameters viz barrel temperature, screw speed (rpm), feed composition, and grain size of PP and HDPE on extrudate output was envisaged. It was found that the extrudate output increases steeply on increasing the average barrel temperature from 100 to 120 degrees C and linearly with screw speed range from 65 to 85 rpm. The effect of grain size had shown decreasing trend in throughput whereas on increasing the polymer content in the feed, throughput was found to be enhanced. Additives such as HPMC were found to be effective when used in synergy with HDPE and PP along with MS. The extrudate throughput was found to be a maximum of 33.01 g/minute at 120 degrees C, 85 screw rpm, 1.40-grain size underfeed with equal proportionate of HDPE/PP with 2% HPMC and 8% MS. This clearly opens the ways for proper utilization of HDPE, PP and MS waste by extrusion and provides the environmental protection solution by utilizing these polluted materials in the fabrication of value-added products through extrusion.

Two batches of powders (conventional and specialty) with widely different attributes, including particles? morphology, size distribution, internal oxidation, surface chemistry and roughness, were separately investigated for the optimized LPBF parameters. It is showed that the specialty powder with a spherical morphology and a larger mean particle size exhibits a higher flowability, as well as a higher apparent density. The latter, together with a smoother surface topography in the specialty powder particles (thus a lower laser absorptivity), necessitates a higher volumetric energy density (VED) requirement for a complete fusion during the LPBF. The as-built microstructures which resulted from both powders show a similar evolution of total porosity content, melt-pool boundaries and solidification structure, both qualitatively and quantitatively, which is consistent with their comparable YS values. The specialty powder, however, yields a higher UTS and %El in the as-built state, which is believed to be due to a scarce presence of O-rich particles (which otherwise preside primarily within the intercellular regions, as is the case for the conventional powder). The emergence of such Orich particles in the as-built microstructure could be traced back to the powder source (i.e., in the form of internal O-rich phases and a thick oxide surface layer in the conventional powder). In other words, an O-lean powder translates into an O-lean printed part. One-time recycling of the specialty powder is shown to have a negligible effect on its morphological characteristics, and thus on the optimized set of parameters, consistently yielding asbuilt YS values similar to those of the original powder. The as-built UTS and %El values resulting from the recycled powder, however, are notably lower than those from the original powder, which are suggested to be due to the presence of contaminants and/or oxide inclusions resulting from the LPBF processing itself and/or during the recycling procedure (e.g., sieving). We believe the correlations established here between the input powder attributes and the LPBF performance of AlSi10Mg alloy can be applicable to many metallic systems.

Starting from the specific experimental capacity (C) and its relationships with the cell charge-discharge rate (R), we propose standardization and normalization parameters and procedures for a vast category of intercalation cathode materials, whose results are given from the literature. The approach is successfully demonstrated for different electrode materials. Despite of the complex chemistry on which Li/Na-ion cells operation is based, the applicability and comprehensiveness of our simple relationship is supported by the general underlying diffusion theory, governing nearly all the cases, and by simple assumptions established by experiments. Our approach offers a clear numerical basis for evaluating the goodness of R-C characteristics, as well as simple criteria for evaluating the cell performance. In the case of poor performance, we show how to separate the contribution of the material from the strategies of the electrode/cell assembly. In the future, this standardization/normalization strategy can also be useful to tackle the issues of battery state-of-health, favoring the correct choices of recycling/reuse in a circular economy perspective.

It has been tested at a scale of 5 t/day feed. The ore concentrate is digested in high-acid, high total chloride solution (+/- 39% Cl). Titanium and iron both go into solution. Iron is separated as FeCl2 crystals after reduction and cooling. Titanium is transferred by solvent extraction into a purified, high-Ti stream. It is spray-hydrolyzed to produce a TiO2 hydrate and further calcined with additives into high-quality pigment. HCl solutions generated by pyrohydrolysis and spray hydrolysis are treated by pressure-swing distillation to regenerate HCl gas for re-injection into the digestion reactor. All chloride streams are recycled. Recent work has concentrated on optimization, particularly in 3 areas: - Solvent extraction: a new organic mixture, including a new diluent, makes it possible to work at room temperature, to avoid TiO2 hydrolysis problems and to improve phase disengagement and impurity separation. - Pigment finishing: a systematic study of the parameters involved, followed by long runs in the best conditions confirm pigment quality. - Flow sheet optimization: innovative modifications of the conditions of spray hydrolysis and pyrohydrolysis, combined with re-routing of streams achieve significant energy savings. A 100 t/year pilot plant including these features as well as other process improvements is under construction.

The presence of impurities in the alloy or addition of H3PO4 was found to suppress the corrosion rate. H3PO4 increased the rates of both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions at high overpotentials for all alloys. Except for Cu-containing alloy, H3PO4 had a slight positive effect on PbO2 formation. The self-discharge of PbO2 under polarization or open-circuit conditions increased in the presence of H3PO4 but the positive grid corrosion decreased, except for the As-containing alloy. Impurity-containing alloys showed significantly lower self-discharge rate in the presence of H3PO4 than in its absence. Impedance measurement was able to detect and quantify the formation of the highly insulating inner PbO layer beneath the outer PbSO4 layer and its transformation to the conducting PbO2, during the oxidation of alloys under constant current conditions. H3PO4 significantly enhanced the formation of PbO in the presence of impurities, especially Sb.	[Abd El-Rahman, H. A.; Gad-Allah, A. G.; Salih, S. A.; Abd El-Wahab, A.

However, the materials engineering is still a challenge for the research of even more effective and performing 3D printable concrete. In this context, we analysed magnesium potassium phosphate cement (MKPC) performance as an innovative cementitious material in terms of sustainability and possibility of its use in extrusion-based 3D concrete printing (3DPC). Starting from common formulations present in literature, we discussed the relationship between water to binder ratio and workability in two different quantities of retarders. Some mix compositions were also prepared by replacing sand with rubber aggregates or glass aggregates with the aim of creating lightweight aggregate-based mortars. In addition, the fly ash (FA), a widely material used (but that will not be available in the next few years), was replaced with silica fume (SF). We found that two formulations (samples 2 and 7) show rheological requirements and compressive strengths at 90 min of respectively about 2 MPa and 3 MPa, which are deemed to be suitable for 3D printing processes. Moreover, in sample 7, the use of the expanded recycled glass as aggregate opens new possibilities for reducing the carbon footprint of the process.

A new series of polyamide elastomers was synthesized using a bio-based dimer diamine monomer as a building block to copolymerize with aminocaproic acid and adipic acid through step-growth polymerization, followed by supercritical CO2 foaming for the fabrication of microcellular foams. The introduction of the branched-structured dimer diamine monomer effectively restricted the molecular packing and hydrogen bonding density of the polyamide system, leading to numerous small crystals acting as nucleation sites for heterogeneous cell nucleation. Simultaneously, the branched long chains of the dimer diamine formed chain entanglement networks, which increased the material melt strength against the elongational stresses of cell growth. The synergistic effect provided by dimer diamine led to the successful manufacture of foamed samples with a high expansion ratio and robust dimensional stability, effectively overcoming the foaming difficulties of high crystallinity and insufficient melt strength in traditional polyamide 6 (PA6). In addition, this polyamide elastomer foam system could be recycled and reprocessed due to the advantages of non-crosslinking and additive-free. Therefore, the study's findings constitute a promising direction for the usage of renewable sources in the development of foamable polyamide materials for sustainable applications in the plastics industry.

Unprocessed machining chips as a practical feedstock in directed energy deposition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						Directed energy deposition; Laser cladding; Machining chips; Reuse; CO2 emissions	STEEL; ALUMINUM; SWARF	Directed energy deposition (DED) is an additive manufacturing process capable of creating parts or coatings from powder or wire feedstocks, and may be adapted to use machining chips. Re-use of steel chips as opposed to landfilling or even recycling, has implications for CO2 emission savings. This is particularly the case of like-forlike replacement of powder and other feedstocks. This work addresses two key concerns which currently impede the implementation of chip-based DED - the impact of residual coolant present on chips on part properties, and whether chip type feedstocks can be delivered in a consistent, practical manner similar to powders. The study demonstrates that DED can generate dense, repeatable deposits from 304L stainless steel milling chips, using both pre-placed and vibrationally fed strategies. Milling chips created with and without the use of machining coolant can both be successfully deposited, without compromising the density of the part. EPMA/XRD/EBSD analysis showed no evidence of coolant in deposits, explained by rapid evaporation, and micro-hardness analysis showed it had no effect on hardness. Practical implementation of chip-based feedstocks into DED systems is validated via use of a bespoke vibration feeding system, which is calibrated in this work, and capable of controlled delivery beneath the laser. Melting behaviour under low power is also investigated, revealing chips are readily melted into droplets and incorporate surrounding chips, ultimately yielding efficient material incorporation into tracks.

Assessment of Hazardous Substances in Electrical Cables: Implementation of RoHS Regulations in India	JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION			English	Article						Restriction of Hazardous Substances compliance; electrical cables; environmental pollution; hazardous substances; lead; informal recycling	PRINTED-CIRCUIT BOARDS; ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT; E-WASTE; LIFE-CYCLE; PLASTICS; CONTAMINATION; SPECTROMETRY; CELLPHONES; METALS; TRENDS	Globally, the use of plastics in electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and home appliances as alternatives to aluminum and steel has been increased rapidly. As a result, the sustainable recycling of plastics in the Indian informal sector has been complicated by hazardous additive substances. In plastics, lead and cadmium compounds are mainly applied as pigments and stabilizing agents. As per the directive of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), for all homogenous materials in the manufacture of various types of EEE, the application of lead, mercury, hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is restricted to a maximum level of 1,000 mu g/g and especially cadmium to a maximum level of 100 mu g/g. In the present work, five electrical cables of various colors and gauges, available in the local market (Hyderabad, India), were chosen for a case study. As per the norms of IEC62321, Electrotechnical Products-Determination of Six Regulated Substances (Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, Hexavalent Chromium, Polybrominated Biphenlys, Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers), the prescreening using Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometer showed the presence of lead only in all cables against the six restricted substances with variable concentrations with color as well as thickness. The maximum lead content observed was similar to 31,000 mu g/g in black cables with a 2.5 mm(2) thickness. The measured lead content using EDXRF spectrometry has cross-checked with other well-established analytical techniques: Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), and the results were found to be comparable. The spiking studies of lead showed that the obtained results by EDXRF spectrometry were within the acceptable range (accuracy limit of 100 +/- 20 %). From the results obtained, it is concluded that the content of lead tested in all the electrical cables selected was more than 1,000 mu g/g and hence found to be noncompliant as per RoHS regulation.

This study investigates interaction of Mg powder with an ultra-high purity (99.9999%) Ar gas using the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technique at different heating rates (5, 10, 15, 20, 22.5, 25, and 28 degrees C/min.). The results showed that Mg powder reacted with even a very low oxygen content present as an impurity in the Ar gas to form MgO at temperatures higher than 400 degrees C. With increasing heating rate, the onset of oxidation shifted to higher temperatures. Furthermore, two distinct thermal behaviour in terms of mass gain was observed for the low (i.e. 5, 10, and 15 degrees C/min) and high heating rates (i.e. 20, 22.5, 25, and 28 degrees C/min). Activation energies of oxidation for Mg powder in Ar gas was derived from the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) method which ranged between 18 and 1743 kJ/mol. Supported by SEM investigations, remarkable differences in the values of calculated activation energies indicated that the oxidation is governed by two different mechanisms at the low and high heating rates. The results of this study provide useful insights to control oxidation of Mg during SLM process and during recycling of used Mg powder. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Factors influencing the brick manufacturing process were analyzed by an experimental design, Taguchi method, to find out the most favorable conditions for the production of bricks. The optimum process conditions for brick preparation were investigated by studying the effects of mixture ratios (0, 5 and 10 wt%) and firing temperatures (850, 950 and 1050 degrees C) on the physical, thermal and mechanical properties of the bricks. Apparent density, bulk density, apparent porosity, water absorption, compressive strength, thermal conductivity, microstructure and crystalline phase formations of the fired brick samples were measured. It was found that the use of 10% waste addition reduced the bulk density of the samples up to 1.45 g/cm(3). As the porosities increased from 30.8 to 47.0%, the compressive strengths decreased from 36.9 to 10.26 MPa at firing temperature of 950 degrees C. The thermal conductivities of samples fired at the same temperature showed a decrease of 31% from 0.638 to 0.436 W/mK, which is hopeful for heat insulation in the buildings. Increasing of the firing temperature also affected their mechanical and physical properties. This study showed that the olive mill waste could be used as a pore maker in brick production.

Their binding performances and effect on paper's mechanical properties were comprehensively studied with the aim to design suitably engineered CBMs as novel biomaterials for use in the production of new cellulose materials. The recombinant engineered double CBMs exhibited obvious differences in their adsorption to different cellulosic substrates. The CBM3-GS-CBM3 was the most effective in enhancing paper mechanical properties in terms of folding endurance (27.4%) and tensile strength (15.5%) among the four engineered double CBMs, but it gave rise to only a slight increase in bursting strength (3.1%). On the other hand, CBM1-NL-CBM1 achieved a significant simultaneous increase in tensile strength (12.6%) and burst strength (8.8%), as well as folding endurance (16.7%). Unexpectedly, CBM3-GS-CBM1 and CBM3-NL-CBM1 had the lowest effective paper property improvement. The differences in types of CBMs and linker peptides in engineered double CBMs may contribute to the considerable differences in their cellulose binding and paper property modification. Our data suggested that CBM1-NL-CBM1 may provide a better upgrade of the secondary pulp, which makes it very suitable for fiber recycling. Meanwhile, CBM3-GS-CBM3 may have particular potential for paper manufacture requiring high folding endurance.

Marshall method of mix design was adopted and mixes properties were determined at lower working temperature by mixing at 130 degrees C,120 degrees C and compacting at 120,110, 100, 90 degrees C to check the influence of these temperatures on asphalt mix properties. The optimum binder content was determined for above combinations. The mixes were tested for moisture susceptibility, fatigue life and rutting resistance. It is observed that RAP Warm SMA prepared using Synthetic fibre exhibited increased stability at 130 degrees C mixing and 120 degrees C compaction temperature. Similarly RAP Warm SMA prepared using Sugar cane fibre showed higher Tensile strength (TSR) value at 130 degrees C mixing and 120 degrees C compaction temperature. It was observed that fatigue life and rutting resistance decreased with reduction in compaction temperature from 130 degrees C to 110 degrees C and 100 degrees C. The optimum mixing and compaction temperature was found to be 1300 and 120 degrees C respectively for sugar cane and synthetic fibres to exhibit better fatigue and rutting resistance.

An associated company has developed plastic concrete made from reused unrecyclable plastic waste. Its intended use is as a construction material. Design/methodology/approach The concrete mix, called PolyBet, composed of polypropylene and glass sand, is printed by the fused deposition modelling process. The process of material and parameter selection is described. The mechanical properties of the filled material were compared to its cast state. Samples were made from castings and two different orientations of 3D-printed parts. Three-point flex tests were carried out, and the area of the break was examined. Computed tomography of the samples was carried out. Findings The influence of the 3D printing process on the material was evaluated. The mechanical performance of the longitudinal samples was close to the cast state. There was a difference in the failure mode between the states, with cast parts exhibiting a tougher behaviour, with fractures propagating in a stair-like manner. The 3D-printed samples exhibited high degrees of porosity. Originality/value The results suggest that the novel material is a good fit for 3D printing, with little to no degradation caused by the process. Layer adhesion was shown to be excellent, with negligible effect on the finished part for the longitudinal orientation. That means, if large-scale testing of buildability is successful, the material is a good fit for additive manufacturing of building components and other large-scale structures.

Pyrolysis of wood waste to produce biochar, that can be used as additive in cement mortar, is a viable alternative to increase recycling rate of woody residues. This article explores influence of biochar, prepared from mixed wood saw dust, on strength, elastic modulus, drying shrinkage and permeability of cement mortar. Biochar prepared by pyrolysis at 300 degrees C (BC 300) and 500 degrees C (BC 500) was added to mortar at 1-8% by weight of cement. Results show that addition of 1-2 wt% BC 300 and BC 500 improve early age (7-day) compressive strength of mortar, which is related to high water retention of 7.50 g/g and 8.78 g/g by dry BC 300 and BC500 respectively. However, addition of biochar did not significantly influence flexural strength, drying shrinkage and modulus of elasticity. Mortar with 1% addition of BC 300 and BC 500 showed up to 58% and 66% reduction in water absorption and depth of water penetration compared to control. Based on the experimental findings, it is concluded that 1-2 wt% addition of biochar may be recommended to improve strength and reduce permeability of cement mortar. This study suggests that biochar from wood waste has the potential to be deployed as carbon sequestering admixture to improve performance of cementitous mortar. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Material selection problems are basically multi-criteria decision making problems as selection of the optimal material is based on the evaluation of conflicting criteria. Considering the limitations such as ranking reversal problem of the various multi-criteria decision making methods available in the literature, a combination of two recently developed techniques, i.e. the Goal Programming Model for Best Worst Method and Proximity Indexed Value method, is employed in the present study. This hybrid method was used for selection of the best possible material for manufacturing of a complex automobile part for which F1 race car as advanced automotive and its gearbox casing as sensitive part was used. Available alternative materials considered in the present study are alloys of aluminum, magnesium, titanium, and carbon fiber/epoxy laminate. Whereas, criteria affecting gearbox casing's performance are tensile strength/density, cost, stiffness, damping capacity, thermal conductivity, and sustainable criteria, such as CO2 emission and recycling energy. Goal Programming Model for Best Worst Method is used to determine weights of the criteria and Proximity Indexed Value method is employed for final selection of material. Furthermore, ranking of alternatives was also supported by other multi-criteria decision making methods namely, range of value, weighted product model, simple additive weighting, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, a combined compromise solution, and the multi-attributive border approximation area comparison. Membership degree method was also employed to obtain the final optimal ranking of alternative materials from individual results of applied multi-criteria decision making methods. Besides, sensitivity analysis is done to validate reliability of the results and to determine the most critical evaluation criterion. The result of this study revealed that carbon fiber/epoxy laminate is the best alternative material.

While the Apollo Lunar Module was designed to house astronauts for only 75 h, a Martian habitat will require a much greater lifespan. For humans to thrive on Mars for any extended period, semi-permanent structures will have to be erected. Such a large and robust habitat would be impractical to transport prefabricated; thus, utilization of local geo-environmental resources is desired. This study presents recent research performed at Northwestern University towards the formulation and characterization of a Martian infrastructure material, called Marscrete. Marscrete is composed, in its simplest version, by sulfur and Martian regolith with a 50-50 mass ratio. Sulfur is plentiful in compounds on and below the surface of Mars, and regolith is a ubiquitous material. Marscrete is the Martian version of traditional sulfur concrete, which is manufactured by melting sulfur and mixing it with sand with approximately a 25-75 mass ratio. Results on compression strength tests, splitting tensile strength, and fracture tests show that Marscrete has significantly better mechanical properties than traditional sulfur concrete and even standard Portland cement concrete. While a generically suitable construction material, Marscrete, when modified with mission-recycled polyethylene fibers, also demonstrates high capabilities for 3D-printing applications-a likely automated construction technique of Martian structures. This paper will discuss the rheological behavior of fresh printable Marscrete, structural performance of the hardened composite, and pose an apparatus to produce 3D-printed Marscrete.

J	Feng, CH; Huang, S; Bai, GZ				Feng Chunhua; Huang Shi; Bai Guozhen			A group decision making method for sustainable design using intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations in the conceptual design stage	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Product sustainability; Conceptual design; Group decision making; Morphological matrix; Intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations; Multi-criteria decision model	QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; PRODUCT DESIGN; AXIOMATIC DESIGN; FRAMEWORK; INDEX; PRINCIPLES	Achieving sustainability in product life cycle involves the complex decision making process such as the selection of conceptual schemes and manufacturing processes, and disposing method of end-of-life. Morphological matrix is simple and useful tool for mapping design requirements in conceptual design for new product design and redesign of out-of-date product. Although conceptual design using morphological matrix as an important step in the product development could achieve sustainability requirements through accurate choice, quantitative decision making method is seldom considered in selection of function solution principle for sustainability. Meanwhile, uncertainties of sustainability attributes in conceptual stage generally are not also considered in these morphological matrix. To solve these problems, this paper put forward an approach based on morphological matrix to satisfy sustainability requirements in product conceptual stage considering vagueness and uncertainty through intuitionistic fuzzy number. The aim of this paper is to quantify conceptual schemes considering sustainability attributes using group decision making and intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations. The decision makers' weights are calculated based on theirs experiences and knowledge on the function, manufacturing, economic, environment, recycle and social properties of product. The morphological matrix is used to establish the relationship between function and solution principles based on sustainability information, then the preference degree are obtained from multiple experts employing intuitionistic fuzzy judgment matrix. The preference degree for each solution principle is quantified by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers through membership, non-membership and hesitancy degree to express the linguistic terminology. To ensure the consistency and consensus issues of preference relations, an additive consistency method is employed, and correction factor is used for achieving modification automatically of judgment matrix when the consistency requirement is not met. Finally, the integrated multi-criteria decision model for function solution principle is established to carry out the final sustainability decision problem in early design stage. The feasibility and validity of proposed method is proved through a practical example for spindle system design of CNC. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Subhy, A; Lo Presti, D				Subhy, Ayad; Lo Presti, Davide			Fatigue and Healing Properties of Low Environmental Impact Rubberized Bitumen for Asphalt Pavement	COATINGS			English	Article						rubberised bitumen; pre-treated crumb rubber; fatigue; healing	DISSIPATED ENERGY APPROACH; TYRE RUBBER; PERFORMANCE; MIXTURES; BINDER	The addition of recycled tyre rubber as a modifier to enhance the mechanical properties of bitumen has proven to provide asphalt mixtures with better mechanical performance. However the rubberised bitumen presents the limitation of requiring higher manufacturing and compaction temperatures. This could be solved by subjecting the tyre rubber to sort of pre-treatments such as: Adding warm-mix additives and/or using partial devulcanisation. These solutions have the potential of lowering the overall environmental impact of the asphalt pavement, however it is still not clear whether these can be detrimental for the rubberized asphalt binder mechanical properties. This paper investigates the effect on fatigue and healing properties of rubberized bitumen blended with pre-treated crumb rubber. An innovative combined fatigue and healing analysis will be presented and used to compare the several rubberised binders with a neat bitumen. The analysis consists in conducting time sweep tests by means of dynamic shear rheometer, by applying repeated cycles of stress or strain loading at selected temperatures and loading frequency. The healing potential of binders was evaluated by introducing short rest periods after a certain number of load pulses. At last, the unique energy parameter obtained using the Ratio of Dissipated Energy Change approach, was applied to obtain a unique index that could provide combined information for both fatigue binder damage and healing phenomenon. The results showed that the analysed rubberised bitumens show having better fatigue and healing performance when compared to the straight-run bitumen.

J	La Guardia, MJ; Hale, RC; Newman, B				La Guardia, Mark J.; Hale, Robert C.; Newman, Brent			Brominated Flame-Retardants in Sub-Saharan Africa: Burdens in Inland and Coastal Sediments in the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; E-WASTE; PBDES; SAMPLES; HBCDS; CHINA; RIVER	Brominated flame-retardant (BFR) additives are present in many polymeric consumer products at percent levels. High environmental concentrations have been observed near cities and polymer, textile, and electronics manufacturing centers. Most studies have focused on European, North American, and Asian locales. Releases are likely rising most dramatically in countries with weak environmental and human health regulation and enforcement, demand for electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) is escalating, and importation of waste EEE occurs. Several African countries meet these criteria, but little data are available on burdens or sources. To better understand the extent of BFR environmental dissemination in a southern African urban community, inland and coastal sediments were collected in the eThekwini metropolitan municipality, South Africa, and analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), 2-ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (TBB), 2-ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5-tretabromophalate (TBPH), 1,2-bis (2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE). BFRs were detected in all samples (n = 45). Concentration data are presented on total organic carbon (TOC) normalized basis. Sigma BFR ranged from 114 to 47 100 ng g(-1). Decabromodiphenyl ether was detected in 93% of samples (mean concentration 3208 ng g(-1)) followed by TBB at 91% (mean conc. 545 ng g(-1)). Durban Bay is strongly influenced by urban runoff and tidal hydrology, and sediments therein exhibited Sigma PBDE concentrations ranging from 1850 to 25 400 ng g(-1) (median conc. 3240 ng g(-1)). These levels rival those in the heavily impacted Pearl River Delta, China. BFRs likely enter the South African environment during manufacture of BFR-containing products, during and following product use (i.e., after disposal and as a result of materials recycling activities), and from nonpoint sources such as atmospheric fallout and urban runoff. These results underline the need to investigate further the environmental burdens and risks associated with BFRs in developing countries.

The potential advantages for integrating three-dimensional (3D) printing into house construction are significant in Construction Industry 4.0; these include the capacity for mass customisation of designs and parameters for functional and aesthetic purposes, reduction in construction waste from highly precise material placement and the use of recycled waste products in layer deposition materials. With the ultimate goal of improving construction efficiency and decreasing building costs, applying Strand7 Finite Element Analysis software, a numerical model was designed specifically for 3D printing in a cement mix incorporated with recycled waste product high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and found that construction of an arched truss-like roof was structurally feasible without the need for steel reinforcements. Design/methodology/approach The research method consists of three key steps: design a prototype of possible structural layouts for the 3DSBP, create 24 laboratory samples using a brittle material to identify operation challenges and analyse the correlation between time and scale size and synthesising the numerical analysis and laboratory observations to develop the evaluation criteria for 3DSBP products. The selected house consists of layouts that resemble existing house such as living room, bed rooms and garages. Findings Some criteria for sustainable construction using 3DP were developed. The Strand7 model results suggested that under the different load combinations as stated in AS1700, the maximum tensile stress experienced is 1.70 MPa and maximum compressive stress experienced is 3.06 MPa. The cement mix of the house is incorporated with rHDPE, which result in a tensile strength of 3 MPa and compressive strength of 26 MPa. That means the house is structurally feasible without the help of any reinforcements. Investigations had also been performed on comparing a flat and arch and found the maximum tensile stress within a flat roof would cause the concrete to fail. Whereas an arch roof had reduced the maximum tensile stress to an acceptable range for concrete to withstand loadings. Currently, there are a few 3D printing techniques that can be adopted for this purpose, and more advanced technology in the future could eliminate the current limitation on 3D printing and bring forth this idea as a common practice in house construction. Originality/value This study provides some novel criteria for evaluating a 3D printing performance and discusses challenges of 3D utilisation from design and managerial perspectives. The criteria are relied on maximum utility and minimum impact pillars which can be used by scholars and practitioners to measure their performance. The criteria and the results of the computation and experimentation can be considered as critical benchmarks for future practices.

The overall mechanical properties of the composite material are controlled and tailored by varying the ratio of the primary constituents (postindustrial cellulose and bentonite clay). This grade of cellulose is no longer suitable for use in the manufacture of recycled paper products and, as such, it is considered a waste product. The described process repurposes this cellulose waste as a component in a structural element that can be worked using standard woodworking tools. The material's compressive strength ranges from approximately 338 psi (2.33 MPa) at low bentonite ratios (less than 50 % by mass) to approximately 1,015 psi (7.01 MPa) at higher bentonite ratios (greater than 60 % by mass). The higher bentonite ratio, Ratio B, has a compressive strength similar to that of a Class 2 burnt brick but does not require the material to be fired (i.e., a significant cost and energy savings). This material can be easily painted, stained, or surface-treated much like wood. However, unlike wood and other masonry products (e.g., concrete), it exhibits a failure mode more similar to that of a polymer where the material does not catastrophically fail rather it slowly yields and shows visible deformation. This mode of failure provides ample warning before a piece fails and gives time for it to be repaired or replaced before catastrophic failure. The material is also lighter and cheaper to produce than most competing products as one of its main components is a postindustrial waste product.

Biotechnological processes offer an economic and versatile way to concentrate and transform resources from waste/wastewater into valuable products, which is a prerequisite for the technological development of a cradle-to-cradle bio-based economy. This review identifies emerging technologies that enable resource recovery across the wastewater treatment cycle. As such, bioenergy in the form of biohydrogen (by photo and dark fermentation processes) and biogas (during anaerobic digestion processes) have been classic targets, whereby, direct transformation of lipidic biomass into biodiesel also gained attention. This concept is similar to previous biofuel concepts, but more sustainable, as third generation biofuels and other resources can be produced from waste biomass. The production of high value biopolymers (e.g., for bioplastics manufacturing) from organic acids, hydrogen, and methane is another option for carbon recovery. The recovery of carbon and nutrients can be achieved by organic fertilizer production, or single cell protein generation (depending on the source) which may be utilized as feed, feed additives, next generation fertilizers, or even as probiotics. Additionlly, chemical oxidation-reduction and bioelectrochemical systems can recover inorganics or synthesize organic products beyond the natural microbial metabolism. Anticipating the next generation of wastewater treatment plants driven by biological recovery technologies, this review is focused on the generation and re-synthesis of energetic resources and key resources to be recycled as raw materials in a cradle-to-cradle economy concept.

Life cycle assessment of the application of nanoclays in wire coating	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STRUCTURAL NANO COMPOSITES (NANOSTRUC 2012)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Structural Nano Composites (NANOSTRUC)	JUL 02-04, 2012	Cranfield Univ, ENGLAND	Nephh, Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), Ecoshell, Agilent Technologies, JM Bioconnect, Eaton, Gerhardt, Fritsch, Nanotechnol Knowledge Transfer Network, Nanotechnol Ind Assoc (NIA), Amer Elements, Cranfield Nano	Cranfield Univ			A life cycle assessment (LCA) is carried out to compare nanoclay-reinforced polymer wire coatings with conventional ones. While the conventional wire coatings contain standard halogen free retardants, in reinforced coatings, montmorillonite (nanoclay) is incorporated into electric cable linings as a rheological agent for an increased resistance to fire. In addition, a reduced load of standard halogen free retardants is obtained. The synergistic effect of the montmorillonite on traditional flame retardant additives (by the formation of a three-dimensional char network) can lead to a revolution in wire production. The application of nanoclays contributes also to anti-dripping effect and flexibility increase [1]. Some producers have already started commercializing wire with nanotechnology-based coating; in the short term the use of nanoclay in wire coating production will probably reach a significant market share replacing traditional formulations. The main aim of this study is to compare the environmental impacts along the life cycle of a traditional wire coating (mineral flame retardants like ATH or MDH in a polymer matrix) with the nanoclay-reinforced wire coating, where the montmorillonite replaces a low percentage of the mineral flame retardant. The system boundaries of the study include the following unit processes: nanoclay production, thermoplastic material and mineral flame retardants production, cable coating manufacturing by extrusion and different end of life scenarios (recycling, incineration and landfill disposal). Whereas nanoreinforced composites have shown and increased fire retardance, the addition of nanomaterials seems to have no significant relevance in the environmental assessment. However, the lack of nano-specific characterization factors for nanomaterials and emission rates associated to the different life cycle stages - mainly in the extrusion and use phase, where accidental combustions can take place-still remains a challenge for realistic life cycle assessment modelling.

Replacing methanol with azeotropic ethanol as the co-solvent for improved chiral separations with supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC)	GREEN CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ENANTIOMERIC SEPARATIONS; MOBILE-PHASE; STATIONARY PHASES; WATER; LIQUID; ENANTIOPURITY; PERFORMANCE; ADDITIVES; INSIGHTS; SPEED	Supercritical and near supercritical fluids are considered green solvents of the future because they decrease the need for toxic organic solvents and are easily recyclable. Consequently, supercritical fluid chromatography, SFC, has emerged as an environment-friendly technique especially for analytical and preparative scale enantiomeric separations. In order to separate a wide range of analytes with differing polarities, most SFC systems employ super- or subcritical carbon dioxide mixed with 5-40% organic solvents. More than 40 chlorinated or non-chlorinated co-solvents have been employed in SFC so far. However, methanol is far and away the dominant SFC mobile phase component as it outperforms most of the other solvents. Given the relatively high cost, non-renewable source of manufacture, and toxicity of methanol in humans, we propose elimination of methanol as a component of the SFC mobile phase by replacing with a biomass derived solvent, i.e., minimum boiling azeotropic ethanol. Azeotropic ethanol contains similar to 4.6% water (aka '190 proof'). It is less expensive and easy to recycle as it distills off at constant composition. This work demonstrates, for the first time, that one can obtain better chiral SFC separations by using '190 proof' ethanol instead of methanol. This solvent choice is shown to be favorable and compatible with a wide range of macrocyclic and chiral polysaccharide column chemistries. In chiral analyses, we show efficiency enhancement up to an order of magnitude and reduced retention by using azeotropic ethanol. In general, SFC separations with azeotropic ethanol can provide enhanced separation performance in a more economical and environmentally friendly format and hopefully change the status quo of current analytical and preparative SFC.

The objective of this resource assessment was to describe the state-level distribution, quantity and market value of lignocellulosic feedstocks for ethanol production in the United States. Lignocellulosic feedstocks, derived from plant materials, are composed primarily of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose are polymers of simple sugars that can be chemically fermented to produce ethanol. Lignin plays a role in binding cellulose and hemicellulose together in plant cell walls. This study focused on lignocellulosic by-products of agriculture, food processing, forest products industry, and consumers. The United States generates 306 million metric tons (dry weight) of lignocellulosic materials annually that could be used to manufacture ethanol. The bulk of this potential feedstock supply is made up of agricultural residues left following crop harvesting, such as corn stover. Corn stover makes up 70 percent of the total biomass resource. If agricultural residues are used for ethanol production, the price paid for agricultural residues will have to meet or exceed their current soil nutrient and animal fodder values. Food processing residues such as corn gluten feed and meal, distillers' dried grains, and spent brewer's grains are used as animal feed additives, which makes them high in cost in relation to other feedstocks. Forest products residues are mostly used for fuel, pulp, animal bedding, or mulch. The unutilized portion of these residues may be available for ethanol production. Recycled paper, sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, paper sludge, and urban tree residue show potential for use as ethanol feedstocks due to their low cost.

The shortage of some kinds the metals is concerning for the industries in question. The development of technologies to recover metals from wastewater and wastes is necessary for securing a stable supply of these metals. The present physicochemical treatments cannot easily recover metals from wastewater and wastes when they are present in low concentrations. In contrast, biochemical treatments, such as biomineralization, are expected to recover these metals efficiently. Selenium (Se) is one of the indispensable metals used in various products, such as electronics, glass manufacturing, pigments, metallurgical additives, and so on. A selenium reducing bacterium, Pseudomonas stutzeri NT-I, was isolated previously. This bacterium reduces soluble seleno-oxyanions to solid elemental selenium efficiently via a bioprocess called biomineralization. RESULTS A polyacrylamide capsule (PAC) containing selenate-reducing bacterium, Pseudomonas stutzeri NT-I, was prepared by double-capsulation to recover selenium from wastewater simply and efficiently. The double-capsulation is inclusion of alginate beads (AB) containing NT-I by polyacrylamide composed of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), N-(2-hydroxyethyl)acrylamide (HEAA), N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]acrylamide (DMAPAA), or (3-acrylamidopropyl)trimethylammonium chloride (APTAC) cross linked by N,N '-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAA). CONCLUSION The PACs had good stability in NaCl aq. and basic water in comparison with non-capsulated AB. HEAA-PAC and APTAC-PAC showed relatively high water-retaining capacity under the wet conditions. Selenate reduction tests were conducted in selenate, Se(VI) aq. at 37 degrees C in the presence of PACs, and APTAC-PAC was effective in reducing and capturing Se.

However, even though current digital design tools allow to effortlessly design and calculate structures, which are exploiting these properties, this potential remains all too often unrealized. This is due to the fact that geometrically complex concrete structures require expensive, one-of-a kind formwork, which can often not be reused or even recycled. Consequently, the current practice for producing non-standard curvilinear architecture in reinforced concrete is neither ecologically sustainable nor economically feasible for a broader range of architectural typologies. Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes, like 3D printing with concrete, on the other hand, currently struggle with the integration of structural reinforcement, limiting the technique to predominantly compression-loaded applications. This research addresses both issues and proposes Mesh Mould, a robotic fabrication process that unifies concrete formwork and structural reinforcement, and hence potentially reduces formwork waste and construction costs for non-standard reinforced concrete constructions. The development of a fully automated robotic fabrication process involved various research disciplines, including architecture, material science, mechanical engineering, robotics as well as civil engineering. This paper describes the technological developments of the Mesh Mould construction system that were necessary to meet the challenges of 1:1 construction. The results are demonstrated in a final loadbearing structure, the Mesh Mould wall of the DFAB HOUSE on NEST.

Life cycle assessment of hot mix asphalt and zeolite-based warm mix asphalt with reclaimed asphalt pavement	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Life cycle assessment; Hot mix asphalt; Warm mix asphalt; Synthetic zeolites; Reclaimed asphalt pavement; Uncertainty analysis		A comprehensive life cycle assessment of asphalt pavements was conducted including hot mix asphalt (HMA), warm mix asphalt (WMA) with the addition of synthetic zeolites, and asphalt mixes with reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). The environmental impacts associated with energy consumption and air emissions were assessed, as well as other environmental impacts resulting from the extraction and processing of minerals, binders and chemical additives; asphalt production; transportation of materials; asphalt paving; road traffic on the pavement; land use; dismantling of the pavement at the end-of-life and its landfill disposal or recycling. Monte Carlo simulations were also conducted to take into account the variability of critical input parameters. Taking into account the entire life cycle, the impacts of zeolite-based WMA pavements were almost equal to the impacts of HMA pavements with the same RAP content. The reduction in the impacts of WMA resulting from the lowering of the manufacturing temperature was offset by the greater impacts of the materials used, especially the impacts of the synthetic zeolites. Moreover, by comparing asphalt mixes with different RAP contents, it was shown that the impacts of asphalt mixes were significantly reduced when RAP was added. All endpoint impacts as well as climate change, fossil depletion and total cumulative energy demand were decreased by 13-14% by adding 15% RAP. A key advantage of WMA is the potentially greater use of RAP. Thus, the decrease in the impacts achieved by adding large amounts of RAP to WMA could turn these asphalt mixes into a good alternative to HMA in environmental terms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

These changes have generated growing pressures for the steel industry to innovate to meet new regulations driving a change to the approach to waste management across the industrial landscape, with increasing focus on the principles of a circular economy. With a knowledge of the compositional profiles of process by-products, we have assessed chemical cleaning to improve environmental performance and minimise disruption to manufacturing processes, demonstrating re-use and recycling capacity. We show that with a knowledge of phase composition, we are able to apply stabilisation methods that can either utilise waste streams directly or allow manipulation, making them suitable for re-use and/or inert disposal. We studied blast furnace slags and Portland cement mixes (50%/50% and 30%/70%) with a variety of other plant wastes (electrostatic precipitator dusts (ESP), blast furnace (BF) sludge and basic oxygen furnace (BOF) sludge) which resulted in up to 90% immobilisation of hazardous constituents. The addition of organic additives i.e., citric acid can liberate or immobilise problematic constituents; in the case of K, both outcomes occurred depending on the waste type; ESP dust BF sludge and BOF fine sludge. Pb and Zn however were liberated with a 50-80% and 50-60% residue reduction respectively, which generates possibilities for alternative uses of materials to reduce environmental and human health impact.

Additionally, mechanical performance of the materials was studied. The VOCs were identified by collecting air samples with Tenax (R) TA tubes and analyzing them with a GC-MS system. UFP concentrations were monitored with a portable ultrafine particle counter. Total VOC emissions of all materials were reduced by 28-68% after 5 thermal cycles (TCs). However, slight accumulation of 1,4-dioxane was observed with poly(lactic acid) materials. UFP emissions were reduced by 45-88% for 3D printing grade materials over 5 TCs but increased by 62% in the case of a waste plastic material over 3 TCs. The mechanical performance of the materials was investigated by measuring their tensile strengths (TSs) and elastic moduli (EM) with an axial-torsion testing system. The reprocessed materials expressed fluctuations in their 3D printing qualities and mechanical performances. The mechanical performances were observed to reduce only slightly after 5 TCs, and the trend was observable only after the data was mass-normalized. The TSs of the samples were reduced by 10-24%, while the EM were reduced by 1-9% after 5 TCs. The TS and EM of one material were increased by 14 and 33%, respectively. In conclusion, recycled polymers are plausible 3D printing feedstock alternatives as they possess acceptable mechanical performance and low emittance according to this study. Furthermore, non-3D printing grade polymers may be applied in a 3D printer with caution.

J	Lusby, G; Hall, C; Reiners, J				Lusby, Gregory; Hall, Cynthia; Reiners, James			Lead Contamination of Surface Soils in Philadelphia from Lead Smelters and Urbanization	ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE			English	Article							X-RAY-FLUORESCENCE; UNITED-STATES; BLOOD LEAD; PB; EXPOSURE; XRF; IDENTIFICATION; GEOCHEMISTRY; SPECTROMETRY; POLLUTION	Lead contamination was introduced into U.S. surface soils at high concentrations during the last century, mainly as a result of lead-based paints and leaded gasoline products. Although these products have not been available or used since the 1995 ban on lead additives in gasoline for automobiles, lead continues to remain in the surface soils of inner cities. Lead (Pb) is a neurotoxin that has been linked to violence and reduced intelligence in children from long-term exposure to contaminated soils. Philadelphia is a city with a history of industrialization and provided a home to several Pb smelters, which extracted Pb from minerals and recycled Pb-waste to use in manufacturing these commercial products. Soils were analyzed in former industrial and non-industrial locations within Philadelphia. Overall, Pb concentrations were found to be higher at locations near former lead smelters than residential sites. Pb concentrations were also elevated in a soil sample adjacent to an old home with visibly weathering paint. One soil sample was further analyzed for its mineralogical composition and was found to contain Pb mostly in the form of an organic compound similar to the tetraethyl-lead compound in leaded gasoline. This study suggests that gasoline was an important source for Pb in surface soils, and that Pb contamination in Philadelphia soils may be quite widespread and not limited to former lead smelter sites and areas adjacent to buildings that contain lead-paint. Further analyses are necessary in order to create a more detailed perspective of existing trends in Pb contamination in Philadelphia soils.

The role of graphene and its derivatives in modifying different phases of geopolymer composites: A review	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Review						Graphene; Geopolymer; Nanomaterials; Composites; Sustainable	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FLY-ASH; GREEN REDUCTION; EFFICIENT ROUTE; LAYER GRAPHENE; NANO-ADDITIVES; MINE TAILINGS; OXIDE; PERFORMANCE; STRENGTH	There is broad agreement among researchers that the next facing of the construction material industry is 'geopolymer composites', also called 'green composites. Although geopolymer composites have been extensively investigated as a new sustainable building material in recent years, their acceptability is still limited owing to few critical fragilities as a commercial material for construction. However, recent progress on geopolymer composites by several scientists suggests that it could be designed at the nanoscale to significantly enhance the chemical and physiomechanical characteristics to overcome multiple limitations. Graphene, a 2D nanomaterial, has been reported to improve various crucial properties when combined with geopolymer composites. This review paper starts with a bibliometric investigation of the studies related to graphene reinforced geopolymer composites (GRGC) to provide useful insights into current research trends. The paper described the synthesis of suitable graphene derivatives and the manufacturing of different phases of GRGC, namely ink, paste, mortar, and composites. Then a critical review is provided on the mechanical and electrical properties enhancement of graphene geopolymer matrix systems through the modification of the composite matrix at the nano-micro structural level. The GRGC has the potential to be used in multiple applications, such as the recycling of industrial solid waste, and is addressed in this paper. Research gaps were identified in the areas of suitable forms of graphene materials synthesis, dispersion, geopolymer binder type, mixing design, microstructure, and acceptance as well as implementation. The review clarifies those challenging aspects and presents guided solutions for developing sustainable, resilient, and efficient geopolymer matrix-based future materials.	[Krishna, R.

J	Butylina, S; Martikka, O; Karki, T				Butylina, Svetlana; Martikka, Ossi; Karki, Timo			Effects of water immersion-freeze-thaw cycling on the properties of wood-polypropylene composites containing pigments	PIGMENT & RESIN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Physical properties of materials; Pigments; Wood-polymer composites; Residual flexural strength; Colour change; Polypropylene; Thickness swelling	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYMER COMPOSITES; PROCESSING METHOD; FLOUR; DURABILITY; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; SURFACE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the effects of water immersion-freeze-thaw treatment on the physical properties, flexural strength (FS) and morphology of wood-polypropylene composites containing pigments. Design/methodology/approach - Wood-polypropylene composites containing brown, green and grey pigments were compounded in a conical twin-screw extruder. A composite manufactured without any pigment addition was used as a reference. The amount of pelletized wood, polypropylene and coupling agent (MAPP) was kept constant. The moisture content thickness swelling (TS), FS and surface colour of the composites were measured before and after water immersion-freeze-thaw cycling. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the morphology of the composites. Findings - FS and dimensional stability were reduced after exposure to water immersion-freeze-thaw cycling for all composites. The surface properties (colour and roughness) of the composites also changed after exposure to water immersion-freeze-thaw cycling. The degree of change depended on the presence of pigment and the type of polypropylene (neat or recycled), however. Research limitations/implications - This study is a part of an ongoing study on weathering of wood-polymer composites (WPC) containing different additives. The results of this study were obtained from accelerated laboratory experiments. Practical implications - Inorganic pigments are widely used as additives in plastics, because they have an excellent UV absorption, good IR-reflective properties and heat stability. The research revealed that metal-containing pigments had an effect on degradation in quality of wood-polypropylene composites exposed to water immersion-freeze-thaw cyclic treatment. The addition of metal-containing pigments to composite formulation resulted in a higher susceptibility of wood-polypropylene composites to water absorption, and as a consequence to a higher drop of FS compared to composites made without pigment. The polymer matrix plays an important role in the protection of WPC against weathering. Originality/value - This paper will help in understanding possible problems in the durability of wood-polypropylene composites compounded with metal-based pigments when they are exposed to water immersion-freeze-thaw cyclic treatment.

J	Gimenez, RG; de la Villa, RV; Goni, S; Frias, M				Garcia Gimenez, Rosario; Vigil de la Villa, Raquel; Goni, Sara; Frias, Moises			Fly Ash and Paper Sludge on the Evolution of Ternary Blended Cements: Mineralogy and Hydrated Phases	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Waste; Activated paper sludge; Fly ash; Blended cement; Pozzolans; Cements	COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; POZZOLANIC REACTION; SLAG; CONCRETE; TEMPERATURE; METAKAOLIN; WASTE	Natural pozzolans are defined as either raw (volcanic material, limestone) or calcined natural materials (burnt shale, calcined kaolinite) with pozzolanic properties. Historically, they are among the oldest materials that have been used in combination with lime for construction purposes. For example, Santorin earth is a natural pozzolan from a volcanic eruption around 1500 BCE on an island of the same name in Greece. Over the last decades, research into cement matrices has been changing direction, owing to deeper environmental concerns over the impact of the cement industry and its consequences for climate change. Global environmental policies are increasingly strict, prioritizing the re-use rather than the disposal of industrial wastes. In this context, one of the biggest challenges is the search for strategies that promote the industrial rotation of high volumes of wastes in their productive cycles. The main purpose of this research is to widen the existing knowledge base on the behavior of new mineral pozzolans of high added value in the cement sector, lending special attention to paper sludge wastes generated in the process of paper manufacture, in which recycled paper is used as a raw material. The results to date show that, once thermally activated (in the range of 650-700 degrees C), paper sludge turns out to be an alternative source of recycled metakaolin. This product is characterized by its high pozzolanic activity and improved performance with regard to the benefits of certain binary cements. The possibility of incorporating this industrial waste in cements along with other already standard pozzolans focuses, as mentioned, on the notable increase in the production of these types of cements. This is due, at present, to the extensive constructive applications for type-II cements (single additive) and to their lower economic and energetic costs that also makes them more suitable in times of economic crisis. In the present paper, the influence that pozzolan blends (activated paper sludge and fly ash) have on the reaction kinetics of ternary blended cements (6 and 21% of replacement) is evaluated, paying special attention to the identification and evolution of hydrated phases with increasing reaction times. The results obtained represent a pioneering research line at a global level and represent a starting point for future investigations because in the case of using paper sludge, release of CO 2 from organic matter is very low and is listed as zero release.

The Use of Aluminosilicates to Create Novel, High Performance and Sustainable Binders for Mortars, Plasters and Renders With Class Leading Low CO2 Footprints	GEOPOLYMER BINDER SYSTEMS	American Society for Testing and Materials Selected Technical Papers		English	Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Geopolymer Binder System	JUN 26-27, 2012	San Diego, CA	ASTM, Comm C01 Concrete, ASTM, Comm C09 Concrete & Concrete Aggregates				Development of sustainable, high performance mortars that are robust and easy-to-use is an important target for the construction industry. Since the 1940s, use of lime mortars for construction has almost vanished as they are slow to cure and more difficult to use compared to cement products. Natural hydraulic limes remain as alternative binders to cement however their slow rate of set and unpredictable, low strengths prove problematic for specifiers and construction companies. Despite its popularity, cement mortars fail to meet most criteria for sustainability due to CO2 emissions from cement manufacture and inability to recycle the material for reuse as binder. Further negative characteristics of cement mortars include excessive strength, inherent brittleness under load and lack of vapour permeability. Our research has explored the development of synthetic or pozzolanic hydraulic lime (PHL) technology to exploit its potentially more attractive sustainable credentials and physical characteristics. Work has focused on potentially highly active and novel additives to improve both the rate of set and overall final strength of mortars. We present preliminary data regarding the use of amorphous synthetic aluminosilicate materials (Al:Si > 1:5) to prepare synthetic hydraulic limes. In contrast to binder reactions which contain either only fly ash or nnetakaolins, the presence of high ratio synthetic aluminosilicate uniquely increases the rate of set, giving mortars with economically useful compressive and flexural strengths. Their reactive efficiency also retains high levels of free calcium hydroxide within a mortar which adsorb significant amounts of CO2 on carbonation giving binders with class leading low CO2 footprints in-use. It is postulated that the presence of dilute sialate species within the alkaline aqueous calcium hydroxide solution may be responsible for the increased reaction rate, producing discrete oligo-sialite species that give rise to long range 3D calcium disilicate/orthosialate species, similar to geopolymer structures. We speculate that such structures are responsible for rate of set and increased strength observed.

However, as missions become more distant and extensive, obtaining these materials from in situ resource utilization is paramount. The combination of microorganisms with electrochemical technologies offers a platform for the production of critical chemicals and materials from CO2 and H2O, two compounds accessible on a target destination like Mars. One such potential commodity is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), a common biopolyester targeted for additive manufacturing of durable goods. Here, we present an integrated two-module process for the production of PHB from CO2. An autotrophic Sporomusa ovata (S. ovata) process converts CO2 to acetate which is then directly used as the primary carbon source for aerobic PHB production by Cupriavidus basilensis (C. basilensis). The S. ovata uses H-2 as a reducing equivalent to be generated through electrocatalytic solar-driven H2O reduction. Conserving and recycling media components is critical, therefore we have designed and optimized our process to require no purification or filtering of the cell culture media between microbial production steps which could result in up to 98% weight savings. By inspecting cell population dynamics during culturing we determined that C. basilensis suitably proliferates in the presence of inactive S. ovata. During the bioprocess 10.4 mmol acetate L-1 day(-1) were generated from CO2 by S. ovata in the optimized media. Subsequently, 12.54 mg PHB L-1 hour(-1) were produced by C. basilensis in the unprocessed media with an overall carbon yield of 11.06% from acetate. In order to illustrate a pathway to increase overall productivity and enable scaling of our bench-top process, we developed a model indicating key process parameters to optimize.

Agronomic effectiveness of an organically enhanced nitrogen fertilizer	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Biosolids; Municipal waste; No-till farming; Plant biomass; Yield components; Corn	NO-TILL CORN; LONG-TERM TILLAGE; NUTRIENT LOSSES; HARVEST INDEX; GRAIN-YIELD; AGRICULTURE; RUNOFF; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; SYSTEM	With tighter environmental regulations and increasing energy costs over time, approaches to minimize losses from commercially available nitrogen (N) fertilizers have become more critical in recent times. An organically enhanced N fertilizer (OENF), manufactured from organic additives extracted from sterilized biosolids plus ammonium sulfate, was evaluated as an alternative N source relative to commercially available N sources, namely, ammonium sulfate and urea. The formulation was tested on corn in 2012 and 2013 at Jackson and Ames, Tennessee, under no-till and plow lands, respectively. Chemically OENF contains 14.9% N, 4.3% P2O5, 18.1% S, 0.6% Fe, and 3.3% OC. The N fertilizer sources were applied at N rates of 0, 85, 128, and 170 kg ha(-1). The P, K, and Zn nutrients were adequately supplied. The OENF and ammonium sulfate produced plant biomass significantly greater than that of urea at N rates of ae<yen>85 kg ha(-1). Despite the fact that less P was supplied to the OENF treatments (36% less P), grain yields from the OENF were similar to those from both ammonium sulfate and urea at N rate of ae<currency>128 kg N ha(-1), but significantly greater than those from urea at 170 kg N ha(-1). The fertilizer type used did not have any significant effects on disease and physical damage to the corn ears at any application rate tested. The OENF could be an alternative N source for crop production and may provide all or some of the P needs for corn production. Therefore, with additional environment benefits of encouraging recycling of municipal and domestic waste and as sources of N, P, S, Fe and organic matter, the use of OENF should be incorporated in various corn production systems.

Sustainable Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures through CO2 Emission Optimization	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Carbon emissions; Cost optimization; CO2 footprint optimization; Greenhouse gas emissions; Reinforced concrete; Optimization; Special design issues	EMBODIED ENERGY; LIFE-CYCLE; BUILDINGS	Efforts are being made to achieve more efficient operation of buildings, with the goal of reducing the construction industry's contribution to energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. That contribution also includes the energy embodied in structures; that is, the energy consumed in the processes of extracting, manufacturing, transporting, and installing construction materials (including recycled materials) and elements. In particular, in spite of the use of additives such as fly ash, reinforced concrete (RC) structures, which are large consumers of cement, are responsible for a sizable proportion of worldwide carbon emissions. These emissions can be reduced significantly through the more efficient use of both concrete and steel that can be achieved by optimization. Modern optimization tools are now available that make it possible to perform large volumes of calculations efficiently that are applicable to a wide variety of structural engineering problems. This study presents an optimization approach developed with a view to allowing decision makers to balance sustainability and economic objectives. To illustrate this approach, an RC frame under gravity and lateral loads is considered in this paper. It was found that, depending upon the parameter values used in the calculations, the design optimized with respect to the CO2 footprint yields a CO2 footprint that is lower (by 5% to 10%) than the design optimized with respect to cost. The reduction can be smaller for low-rise structures and other structures with predominantly tension-controlled members. However, for structures whose members predominantly experience large compressive forces, such as high-rise buildings, the reduction may be more significant. This also may be true of certain prestressed and poststressed concrete members. Additional research aimed at ascertaining the extent to which this is the case is warranted.

J	Aguilar-Rivera, N				Aguilar-Rivera, Noe			Emerging technology for sustainable production of bleached pulp from recovered cardboard	CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY			English	Article						Old corrugated containers; Alkaline delignification; TCF bleaching; Optical and strength properties	OLD CORRUGATED CONTAINER; RAW-MATERIAL; OCC PULP; PAPER; PAPERMAKING; PEROXIDE; STRENGTH; FIBERS; OXYGEN	Post-use corrugated packaging cardboard is commonly known as old corrugated containers (OCC). They are complex and heterogeneous materials composed of various sources of unbleached cellulose pulp derived from several raw material processes which must be revalued due to its functionality, recyclability, and biodegradability. Besides, as recovered pulp have a greater composition of long fiber than short fiber because are mainly manufactured from softwood pulp by the kraft process. OCC are the main category of recovered paper; however, due to their high lignin content and hemicelluloses, additives, pollutants, hornification and degradation of fibers and other problems resulting from the pulp to cardboard conversion processes, their physical properties decrease with each recycling or reprocessing, which justifies evaluating a set of technologies to improve it. The objective of this work was to obtain improved unbleached and bleached OCC pulp more ecologically and economically justifiable than derived from wood chips for higher grade papers using sustainable processes evaluated in pilot scale tests. Mixed OCC were collected as waste from a landfill, cleaned, repulped, and treated with extended delignification with the alkaline soda process, obtaining a pulp with significant physical-mechanical improvements in relation to the original material, such as tensile strength, tearing resistance, bursting strength and folding endurance. The OCC soda pulp was bleached by a sequence totally free of chlorinated compounds (TCF), obtaining bleached pulp with optical and mechanical properties comparable to virgin pulps of annual plants such as bagasse but with improved drainage properties and lower processing costs. According to their properties, it is a competitive pulp obtained with emerging and existing technologies, available for use in various grades of printing and writing paper replacing totally or partially bleached wood pulp.

Nitrogen Transformation, Ammonia Volatilization Loss, and Nitrate Leaching in Organically Enhanced Nitrogen Fertilizers Relative to Urea	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; ACID SOILS; BIOSOLIDS; MINERALIZATION; NITRIFICATION; MICROORGANISMS; AMENDMENTS; MANAGEMENT; BERTHELOT; GROWTH	New N fertilizer products-organically enhanced NS plus and organically enhanced NS plus with Fe, manufactured by using sterilized and chemically converted organic additives extracted from municipal wastewater biosolids, were evaluated for N mineralization, ammonia (NH3-N) volatilization, N leaching, and effects on soil acidification, relative to urea. Laboratory incubations at three temperatures (20, 30, and 40 degrees C), two leaching schemes (continuous and intermittent irrigation regimes), and ammonia volatilization experiments under aerobic (upland) and anaerobic (flooded) conditions were conducted in four appropriate soils (Greenville loam [fine, kaolinitic, thermic Rhodic Kandiudults], Lakeland sand [thermic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments], Guthrie silty-clay [fine-silty, siliceous, thermic Typic Fragiauults], and Sumter clay [fine-silty, carbonatic, thermic Rendollic Eutrudepts]). The two organically enhanced fertilizers had significantly lower nitrification than urea. At all three temperature levels in Greenville soil, the lag phase during the nitrification process was 28.6 d for organically enhanced fertilizers compared to 5.5 d for urea. The longer lag phase duration with organically enhanced fertilizers could result in reduced nitrate losses. Amending Guthrie soil with organically enhanced fertilizers had NH3-N volatilization losses (5 and 22% of applied N) significantly lower than those of the urea-fertilized Guthrie soil (33 and 58% of applied N) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Nitrate leaching with the two irrigation regimes in Lakeland sand was significantly lower for organically enhanced fertilizers than urea. Thus, the organically enhanced fertilizers could be an attractive N source. The environmental and food security benefits of organically enhanced fertilizers result from both recycling of sterilized and converted organic wastes (C, amino acids, and micronutrients) and minimizing the N losses from land to atmosphere and from land to water, which are characteristic of a disrupted N cycle and meet the standards on nutrient management set by NRCS.

Optimization of a wood plastic composite for architectural applications	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE AND INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING (RESIM 2016)	Procedia Manufacturing		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Sustainable and Intelligent Manufacturing (RESIM)	DEC 14-17, 2016	Leiria, PORTUGAL			Wood Plastic Composite; Pine Wood Particles; High Density Polyethylene; Coupling Agent; Extrusion; Wood Residues	FIBER; COMPATIBILIZATION; SILICA; FLOUR	The actual demand for sustainable construction has fostered the research of alternative products made of new materials, such as composites based on renewable resources obtained directly from nature or, most importantly in this context, from the wastes of industries thus encouraging the implementation of recycling processes. This study reports the optimization of wood plastic composites (WPC) made of industrial residues of pine sawdust, high density polyethylene (HDPE) and maleic anhydride-grafted-polyethylene (PE-g-MA) as coupling agent. These composites were specifically designed for the production of an innovative shading system to apply in the forefront of buildings, thus requiring an adequate combination of material properties concerning resistance to weather conditions, with mechanical and functional performance of the final products. The composites were optimized to enable their production and the fabrication of the shutter units through sequential extrusion processing. The optimization of the composites started with a thorough characterization of the raw materials and the mixtures were prepared after analysing the effect of the concentration of pine sawdust in the polymeric matrix, with variable amounts of the coupling agent. Torque rheometry was used to determine the most adequate viscosities for extrusion processing. The composites with optimized contents of pine sawdust and additives were characterized using SEM, FTIR, DSC-TGA, tensile testing, measurements of water contact angle and water absorption capacity. This allowed determining the respective microstructure, chemical interactions, thermal stability, mechanical properties, surface wettability and swelling capacity. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This treaty mandates that parties who have signed must take administrative and legislative actions to prevent the environmental impacts that POPs pose, both within their jurisdictions and in the global environment. The specific BFRs listed in the Stockholm Convention are Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs), Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), and Hexabromobiphenyl (HBB), chemicals which must therefore be heavily restricted within the jurisdictions of the signatories. As an example, within the EU, hexabromobiphenyl (HBB), the PBDE commercial mixtures, and HBCDD are almost entirely prohibited in terms of both production and use in commercial goods. Waste articles containing excess concentrations of these BFRs are similarly restricted and must be disposed of in a manner that destroys or irreversible transforms the BFR in question. In some cases, specific exemptions for these limits are defined by the Convention for certain parties: for example, Penta- and Octa-BDE can be present in waste materials for recycling until 2030, while Deca-BDE can be applied to some aviation and automotive applications until 2036. However, in such cases, very specific criteria and guidelines apply for their use and/or production. Worldwide, China, Japan, India, and the United States of America have made significant advances in the regulation of POPs, in line with the provisions of the Stockholm Convention. China has established concentration limits for Penta- and Octa-BDEs in electronic goods. It is also currently availing of an exemption to allow for the use of HBCDD and has not yet ratified the Convention with regards to Deca-BDE. Japan meanwhile has classified HBB and Penta-/Octa-BDE compounds as Class I Specified Chemical Substances which virtually prohibits the manufacture, import, and use of these chemicals in all applications. India has banned the manufacture, trade, import, and use of HBB, HBCDD and some PBDEs, and has established concentration limits for all PBDEs in certain electrical goods. Finally, the United States has no federal mandate for the restriction of POPs and has not ratified the annexes to the Convention requiring them to do so. However, thirteen states have implemented their own state-wide concentration limits on a variety of flame retarding chemicals in various commercial applications. Though these limits worldwide are a very positive step for the removal of POP-BFRs from the environment, the increased use of replacement flame retardants renders such legislation only partially effective. The lack of effective screening mechanisms in waste management facilities means that BFR-treated plastics can be inadvertently recycled and remain in circulation. The rise in the use of novel BFRs (NBFRs) can furthermore hinder screening methods currently being developed and the additives themselves may pose similar issues to their predecessors owing to their similar chemical properties. Thus, restrictions on current BFRs will result in the use of new flame retardants, which may in turn be banned and replaced once again. Further research into and development of methods to screen for hazardous chemicals in end of life materials is therefore of the utmost importance. This must be coupled with pro-active legislation that eliminates the need for using such persistent and potentially harmful chemicals in the future.

J	Tebaldo, V; Faga, MG				Tebaldo, Vincenzo; Faga, Maria Giulia			Influence of the heat treatment on the microstructure and machinability of titanium aluminides produced by electron beam melting	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Titanium aluminide; Electron beam melting; Dry turning; Microstructure; Crystalline phases; Wear	WORKPIECE SURFACE INTEGRITY; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TIAL ALLOY; GAMMA; TEMPERATURE; INTERMETALLICS; COMPONENTS; LIFE; DRY	Additive manufacturing (AM) has been emerging as a promising fabrication technology for polymers and metal products. This technology is able to fabricate complex shape components with high geometrical freedom and allows to reduce the overall waste material, as the powder can be recycled several times, and time from drawing to production can be consistently reduced. In the case of materials for aerospace applications, like TiAl alloys, conventional machining is needed to obtain the required surface finish. The machinability is strongly dependent on the specific alloys and on the production technology used, leading to different microstructures, that can be tuned undergoing the alloys to several treatments after the AM process. The paper focus on the effect of post processing treatment on hardness, structural properties and machinability of Ti48Al2Nb2Cr obtained by electron beam melting process. Untreated and heat treated alloys were considered. Turning tests were carried out under dry conditions by using cemented carbides cutting tools coated with TiCN-Al2O3-TiN. The structure, microstructure and hardness of the material were studied and related to machinability, that was evaluated in terms of tool life and surface integrity, focusing on both surface and sub-surface alterations. Tool wear, cutting forces, chip morphology and surface roughness were also analyzed. Adhesion prevailed on abrasion as main wear phenomenon, leading to cutting edge breaking. Results indicated a higher machinability of the alloys that underwent post processing treatment because of the different microstructure and crystalline phases induced. Indeed, c42 and f3 phases present in heat treated material enhanced the formation of built up edge, acting as protective layer and then slowing down the degradation phenomena. Also the lower porosity leaded to a lower diffusion phenomenon, positively affecting the tool life. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Rhodes, CJ				Rhodes, Christopher J.			Plastic pollution and potential solutions	SCIENCE PROGRESS			English	Article							MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION; MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; SYNTHETIC-FIBERS; GARBAGE PATCH; HUMAN HEALTH; GREAT-LAKES; BISPHENOL-A; DEBRIS	A review is presented of the manufacture and use of different types of plastic, and the effects of pollution by these materials on animal, human and environmental health, insofar as this is known. Since 2004, the world has made as much plastic as it did in the previous half century, and it has been reckoned that the total mass of virgin plastics ever made amounts to 8.3 billion tonnes, mainly derived from natural gas and crude oil, used as chemical feedstocks and fuel sources. Between 1950 and 2015, a total of 6.3 billion tonnes of primary and secondary (recycled) plastic waste was generated, of which around 9% has been recycled, and 12% incinerated, with the remaining 79% either being stored in landfills or having been released directly into the natural environment. In 2015, 407 million tonnes (Mt) of plastic was produced, of which 164 Mt was consumed by packaging (36% of total). Although quoted values vary, packaging probably accounts for around one third of all plastics used, of which approximately 40% goes to landfill, while 32% escapes the collection system. It has been deduced that around 9 Mt ofplastic entered the oceans in 2010, as a result of mismanaged waste, along with up to 0.5 Mt each of microplastics from washing synthetic textiles, and from the abrasion of tyres on road surfaces. However, the amount of plastics actually measured in the oceans represents less than 1% of the (at least) 150 Mt reckoned to have been released into the oceans over time. Plastic accounts for around 10% by mass of municipal waste, but up to 85% of marine debris items - most of which arrive from land-based sources. Geographically, the five heaviest plastic polluters are P.R. China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, which between them contribute 56% of global plastic waste. Larger, primary plastic items can undergo progressive fragmentation to yield a greater number of increasingly smaller 'secondary' microplastic particles, thus increasing the overall surface area of the plastic material, which enhances its ability to absorb, and concentrate, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), with the potential to transfer them to the tissues of animals that ingest the microplastic particles, particularly in marine environments. Although fears that such microparticles and their toxins may be passed via Pod webs to humans are not as yet substantiated, the direct ingestion of inicroplastics by humans via drinking water is a distinct possibility - since 92% of samples taken in the USA and 72% in Europe showed their presence - although any consequent health effects are as yet unclear. Foodstuffs may also become contaminated by microplastics from the air, although any consequent health effects are also unknown. In regard to such airborne sources, it is noteworthy that small plastic particles have been found in human lung tissue, which might prove an adverse health issue under given circumstances. It is also very striking that microplastics have been detected in mountain soils in Switzerland, which are most likely windborne in origin. Arctic ice core samples too have revealed the presence of microplastics, which were most likely carried on ocean currents from the Pacific garbage patch, and from local pollution from shipping and fishing. Thus, sea ice traps large amounts of microplastics and transports them across the Arctic Ocean, but these particles will be released into the global environment when the ice melts, particularly under the influence of a rising mean global temperature. While there is a growing emphasis toward the substitution of petrochemically derived plastics by bioplastics, controversy has arisen in regard to how biodegradable the latter actually are in the open environment, and they presently only account for 0.5% of the total mass of plastics manufactured globally. Since the majority of bioplastics are made from sugar and starch materials, to expand their use significantly raises the prospect of competition between growing crops to supply food or plastics, similarly to the diversion of food crops for the manufacture of primary biofuels. The use of oxo-plastics, which contain additives that assist the material to degrade, is also a matter of concern, since it is claimed that they merely fragment and add to the environmental burden of microplastics; hence, the European Union has moved to restrict their use. Since 6% of the current global oil (including natural gas liquids, NGLs) production is used to manufacture plastic commodities predicted to rise to 20% by 2050 the current approaches for the manufacture and use of plastics (including their end-use) demand immediate revision. More extensive collection and recycling of plastic items at the end of their life, for re-use in new production, to offset the use of virgin plastic, is a critical aspect both for reducing the amount of plastic waste entering the environment, and in improving the efficiency of fossil resource use. This is central to the ideology underpinning the circular economy, which has common elements with permacultum, the latter being a regenerative design system based on 'nature as teacher' which could help optimise the use of resources in town and city environments, while minimising and reputposing 'waste'. Thus food might be produced more on the local than the global scale, with smaller inputs of filels (including transportation fuels for importing and distributing food), water and fertilisers, and with a marked reduction in the use of plastic packaging. Such an approach, adopted by billions of individuals, could prove of immense significance in ensuring future food security, and in reducing waste and pollution - of all kinds.

The proof is represented by the growing interest in food loss and waste of different sectors, from the political to the academic, or even to the private sector. In order to reduce food waste and to increase sustainability, the European Union (EU) has planned a circular bioeconomy. This action plan includes an approach based on reducing, reusing, recovering, and recycling materials and energy. Every year, there are high amounts of waste and by-products resulting from agricultural producing and agro-industrial processing, impacting the environment and the socio-economic sector. Cereal food products cover over 20% of daily diet, so it can be assumed that cereal production and processing are one of the most important sectors of agri-food industries. It is estimated that the waste generated from cereal processing and manufacturing is up to 13%, a percentage that can be decreased by converting the by-products in raw materials for biofuels, biodegradable plastics, alcohols, antioxidants, food additives, or pharmaceutic ingredients due to their content in macro- and micro-nutrients or bioactive compounds. Based on the fact that diet plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of our body, it is important to capitalize on any source of bioactive compounds to which we have access. This review aims to highlight the need to recirculate by-products for the purpose of extraction and use of their key compounds, polyphenols, which have not only antioxidant effects, but also preventive and therapeutic effects against cancer. For these, it is necessary to understand the biotechnologies needed for processing the most consumed cereals, the methods of extraction of phenolic compounds, and the main effects that these compounds have, summarizing the most relevant in vitro and in vivo studies performed so far.

Benefits and limitations of three-dimensional printing technology for ecological research	BMC ECOLOGY			English	Article						3D models; Additive manufacturing; Anolis sagrei; Clay model; Curacao; Maya autodesk; Sustainability	3D PRINTER; MODELS; EMISSIONS; PARTICLES; PREDATORS; BEHAVIOR; FUTURE; TRAPS; LIFE	Background: Ecological research often involves sampling and manipulating non-model organisms that reside in heterogeneous environments. As such, ecologists often adapt techniques and ideas from industry and other scientific fields to design and build equipment, tools, and experimental contraptions custom-made for the ecological systems under study. Three-dimensional (3D) printing provides a way to rapidly produce identical and novel objects that could be used in ecological studies, yet ecologists have been slow to adopt this new technology. Here, we provide ecologists with an introduction to 3D printing. Results: First, we give an overview of the ecological research areas in which 3D printing is predicted to be the most impactful and review current studies that have already used 3D printed objects. We then outline a methodological workflow for integrating 3D printing into an ecological research program and give a detailed example of a successful implementation of our 3D printing workflow for 3D printed models of the brown anole, Anolis sagrei, for a field predation study. After testing two print media in the field, we show that the models printed from the less expensive and more sustainable material (blend of 70% plastic and 30% recycled wood fiber) were just as durable and had equal predator attack rates as the more expensive material (100% virgin plastic). Conclusions: Overall, 3D printing can provide time and cost savings to ecologists, and with recent advances in less toxic, biodegradable, and recyclable print materials, ecologists can choose to minimize social and environmental impacts associated with 3D printing. The main hurdles for implementing 3D printing-availability of resources like printers, scanners, and software, as well as reaching proficiency in using 3D image software-may be easier to overcome at institutions with digital imaging centers run by knowledgeable staff. As with any new technology, the benefits of 3D printing are specific to a particular project, and ecologists must consider the investments of developing usable 3D materials for research versus other methods of generating those materials.

In the brewing process, this cake is composed mainly of organic matter containing high fiber content, provided by the separation of suspended particles through wort filtration. The study presented here was carried out to assess if the spent brewery grains could be recycled through their incorporation in a paste used in the manufacture of ceramic bricks, and how such incorporation affects some of the physical properties, namely mechanical strength, porosity, and thermal conductivity of the ceramic material. The main objective of the study was to decrease the thermal conductivity of the ceramic paste without significant losses of the mechanical strength of the final product. Spent brewery grains (SBG) characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, and heat of combustion were used as an additive (pore-forming agent) to a brick paste, characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, particle-size analysis, mechanical strength, plasticity index, and thermal conductivity determinations. Powder mixtures obtained by addition of 5, 10, and 15% by weight of dry SBG to brick raw material (SBG-to-brick paste weight) were assembled. The powder mixtures were extruded and the green probes were dried (105 degrees C) before slow firing at 900, 950, and 1,000 degrees C. Drying and firing shrinkages and mechanical bending strengths were investigated in addition to bulk density, open porosity, water absorption, and thermal conductivity of the fired samples. The mixture of ceramic paste with SBG fired up to 900 degrees C with an incorporation of SBG of 5% by weight was found to reach a compromise between the highest mechanical bending strength (15MPa) and the lowest thermal conductivity (0.46Wm-1K-1). When compared with the ceramic paste without SBG incorporation, a diminution of 12 and 28% of the values of these properties, respectively, was obtained.

Consequently, the environmental and health issue related to ore extraction has led to an increased awareness of the importance of recovering mining sites. In this study, samples taken from tailings located in the abandoned metallic mine named La Union (Mazarambroz, Spain) have been studied to sinter lightweight aggregates (LWAs). The fraction <63 mu m was selected and mixed with 10 wt% of a sepiolite residue to gain plasticity. Likewise, 2.5 wt% of thermoplastic (P) and 2.5 wt% of carbon fiber (FC) wastes were added in powder form to check the effect of these two additives. The mixtures were blended with water, extruded, shaped into pellets, oven-dried and finally fired at 1175 degrees C for 4 min in a rotary kiln. The main technological properties of the aggregates related to bloating, density, porosity, loss on ignition, water absorption and mechanical strength were determined. Quantitative changes in mineralogy and glass formation were studied using the Rietveld refined XRD technique. Microstructural and textural characteristics were studied by microscopy. Dark color LWAs of high porosity, low density and good mechanical strength were obtained. The addition of Pad FC allowed the development of a well-distributed-porous core surrounded by a very thin shell, in contrast to the thick cortex formed when these components were not used. While the addition of FC did not mean real advantages in the technological properties, P promoted greater bloating and lower density. A high volume of glass was evolved in all the aggregates (>= 60%) and augite was the main neo-formed mineral. Pyrrotite was also neo-formed, but its proportion was negligible to be detected by XRD, so that it could be only observed by SEM-EDX microscopy. These results are encouraging to continue investigating these wastes and the aggregates manufactured from them in order to determine their capacity to immobilize hazardous metals and their potential application in lightweight concrete, agriculture or civil engineering.

Incorporation of paper sludge in clay brick formulation: Ten years of industrial experience	APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE			English	Article						Paper sludge; Clay ceramics; Leaching; Gaseous emissions; Industrial production	SEWAGE-SLUDGE; WASTE; CERAMICS; ASH; RESIDUES; PULP	The large amounts of sewage sludge (11 million tonnes in Europe in 2005) produced in paper manufacturing plants require the introduction of recycling and/or alternative recovery solutions to minimize the amounts of generated waste, such as its use in soil remediation or in the cement industry. A feasible alternative to valorize that waste is the use of paper sludge as raw material in the production of structural ceramic or clay bricks. Previous studies tried to incorporate sewage sludge from different sources into ceramic matrices, unfortunately with little success in the final result for most types of sludge. However, those experiments carried out using as additive sludge from the paper industry succeeded in producing a material suitable for the red ceramic industry. In this paper, binary mixtures of clay and paper sludge under different formulations were produced and their physico-chemical properties were studied. Increasing the paper sludge content in the clay mixture provides the material with improved properties regarding its thermal and acoustic insulation, but in turn it decreases its mechanical strength. However, this fragility of the material is compensated by an increased ductility. Regarding metal leaching, the studied ceramics have no environmental restrictions as far as their use as building material is concerned, as the obtained results were virtually identical to those for the blank samples (100% clay). Results showed that the presence of dichloromethane (373.2 mu g m(-3)) and propanone (61.2 mu g m(-3)) in the samples with added sludge was relatively relevant with respect to concentrations in samples made of 100% clay. All monocyclic aromatics detected showed a concentration level far below their odor threshold. In general, thus, it can be concluded that volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions during firing of the new ceramic material do not involve any particular problem. Finally, the experience obtained after more than 10 years of industrial production of this new mixed ceramic product was also analyzed. This analysis allowed confirmation that clay brick production with incorporation of paper sludge waste is a feasible solution from a technical point of view. As a key outcome, this fact has helped the reduction in a large proportion the amount of sludge produced by the Spanish paper industry ending up in landfills. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Volotskoy, A; Yurkin, Y; Avdonin, V				Volotskoy, Alexey; Yurkin, Yuriy; Avdonin, Valeriy			New Thermoplastic Damping Polymeric Materials Based on Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate	MATERIALE PLASTICE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Polymer Processing in Engineering (PPE) Conference	OCT 07-09, 2019	Galati, ROMANIA			Damping; Dynamic mechanical properties; Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA); Ethylenevinyl acetate (EVA); Elastic properties		This article is devoted to the problem of working out of damping polymer materials which are effective in the wide temperature and frequency range. In the modern world, work is being carried out to create damping polymer composite materials (DPM) from which it is possible to manufacture protective elements and parts of engineering structures of reduced vibration excitability. Existing DPM have a narrow temperature range, within which effective vibration absorption is observed, moreover, most of them go through a vulcanization stage, which increases the cost of the final product, has a harmful effect on environment and allows limited recycling of waste. One of the ways to solve this problem is to replace traditional rubber vibration-absorbing materials with thermo-elastoplasts (TEP). The most promising polymer for TEP is ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), which has high damping properties, oil resistance and relative incombustibility. In this regard, experimental studies were conducted to establish the patterns of influence of the type and concentration of structure-forming components (plasticizers, fillers, modifiers) on the dynamic mechanical properties of TEP based on EVA in order to develop a new DPM effective in a wide temperature range. The leading method to investigate this problem is a method of dynamic mechanical analysis which allows to get information about changes of mechanical characteristics under mechanical load and controlled temperature and frequency. With the help of detected patterns it was possible to determine type of plasticizer which significantly decreases glass temperature of EVA. The percentage ratio of EVA/ plasticizer system is stated, and the type of plasticizer at which the maximum of mechanical losses takes over greater values is accordingly detected. It is revealed, that to work out DPM on EVA basis, which are effective in wide temperature range it is more preferable to add not less than 40 % on volume basis inert fillers, such as talc or mica with addition of 5-10 % of carbon as the hardening additive. The kind of resin improving damping properties and raising rigidity of composites on EVA basis is defined. On the basis of the research, a material was developed which has the following properties: the maximum value of tan delta is at least 0.45 at a temperature of plus 5 degrees C (oscillation frequency 10 Hz); width of the temperature interval within which tan d is not less than 0.3 from minus 40 to plus 50 degrees. (oscillation frequency 10 Hz); conditional tensile strength of not less than 10 kg/cm(2), cold resistance up to minus 50 degrees C.

INFLUENCE OF TECHNOGENESIS ON FORMING ELEMENT COMPOSITION OF CHILDRENS HAIR	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING			Russian	Article						Children's hair; elemental composition; biogeochemical specificity; environment; rare earth elements; technogenesis		The relevance of the research is supported by the necessity of elaborate the criteria for assessing the environment condition. Biogeochemical study of all objects and components of the biosphere is rather relevant task of modern times. Local technogenic transformations of areas cause spontaneous, irregular income of elements to the living organisms. Study of element composition of human hair proved itself to be good for assessing this income degree. Human hair is a deposit environment and can serve as an indicator for anthropogenic change of the environment. The aim of the study is to investigate the accumulation specificity of chemical elements in the content of children's hair under the influence of technogenesis and to find the indicators of this influence. The research methods: instrumental neutron activation analysis (quantitative determination of 29 chemical elements), mass-spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma ICP-MS. Results. The authors have determined the peculiarities of formation of element composition of children's hair (3-18 years old) in the area of Northern industrial hub of Tomsk. For this purpose, the investigated area was divided into sectors taking into account the prevailing << wind rose >> (the axes were run across Tomsk). The first sector - the north north-eastern is - subject to the most influence of technogenesis; in comparison with other sectors it is characterized by the maximal accumulation of Sc, Cr, Zn, Lu, Hf, Au, Th, U, Cs in hair. The second one, the eastern sector, in comparison with the others is distinguished by the maximal accumulation of Se, Yb, Ag, Eu with concentrations, which are higher than average regional values. The third, western, sector is characterized by the highest Sb accumulation level. The fourth one, the southern sector, can be considered as the background sector with low concentrations of the most studied elements. In addition, the authors compared the data with the results of investigation of chemical elements content in the hair of Seversk and Tomsk residents. The investigation shown that Seversk, compared to other areas, is characterized by the maximal accumulation of Br, Ta, U and Ce. For the hair samples from Tomsk, La, Sm and Eu are specific. In the villages, located near tailings, the accumulation level of elements 6,5 times exceeds the background level. For the hair from both villages, the high level (2,5 times exceeds the background) of Au, Ag, TI, Re, Eu, Li contents is specific. Conclusions. The element composition of children's hair in the studied area reflects the specificity of technogenic influence of different manufacturing enterprises in Northern industrial hub of Tomsk; and in general, it is formed under the additive effects of natural and technogenic aspects. In the areas with the most active technogenic impact, the concentrations of element in the hair are higher and the range of elements is wider in comparison with the average regional factors and background data. Urban territories are distinguished by Br and rare earth elements accumulation in children's hair. Human settlements, which are not subject to the main impact of industrial enterprises and located in thirty-kilometer area of SCC impact, at prevailing direction of wind transfer of the substances, suffer the technogenic influence. The southern part of Tomsk district can be considered as background area with low concentrations of the majority of the studied elements. The indices of elements ratio are significant indicators of technogenesis conditions. Tomsk district as the most technogenic-transformed area is characterized by specific concentration of lanthanides in the children's hair. In the territories with the stored wastes of enrichment production, the concentration of chemical elements, reflecting the specificity of the produced and recycled materials, is specific for children's hair. Therefore, children's hair is the demonstrating factor of technogenic load on the residential areas.
